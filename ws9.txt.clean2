This is one of the strangest short-story collections I have ever read.  Then again, I had come to expect that from the author of the brilliant short-fiction book The Girl in the Flammable Skirt.  Now Aimee Bender writes some rather dark, strange and disarming stories in Willful Creatures that will truly shock you and keep you thinking long after you finish reading each story.  The characters are nameless, unflinching in their actions and quite unlikeable, doing things that will repel and compel you at the same time.  From bad parents, shameless seducers and abusers who target upon the weak, this collection has it all.  My favorite stories are \\"The Leading Man,\\" \\"Debbieland,\\" \\"Dearth,\\" \\"The Meeting,\\" and \\"End of the Line.\\"  All of the stories are amazing, but the aforementioned ones stood out the most for me.  I marvel at Bender's writing style.  She reminds me a great deal of Amanda Filipacchi in that she mixes the outlandish with the mundane in an astonishing, hilarious twist.  Are you in the bargain for some literary and surreal short stories?  I recommend you read Willful Creatures.  And give The Girl in the Flammable Skirt a whirl while you're at it.	2005-10-11

Ninety-seven handy suggestions to improve the quality of your best friend's life with fun and games and the occasional good-spirited prank.<br /><br />My mom has this book and her kind-natured, if slightly dim three-year-old Chessie-Collie mix, Fergus, loves some of the suggestions in here. One of the ones I've tried with him is number eighty-two: slingshooting treats for him to catch using a plastic spoon as a catapult. Another one that seems particularly enjoyed is number eighteen: juggling. I've always been a good juggler and when I juggle things Fergus wants, like a trio of rolled-up socks or tennis balls, he goes NUTZ trying to leap up and get what I'm keeping right out of his reach. It's a hoot.<br /><br />The one suggestion that really tripped me out, though, and had me laughing was number thirty-two: \\"The Three Little Bears routine\\" which involves sneaking into your pet's bed and letting him catch you there for a change. Ha!!! Haven't tried that one yet but maybe I will when the time is right. Justice for all the times he's sneaked up onto Mom's furniture and stuff.<br /><br />This cheerful little book is great not only for the ideas it gives you but for its ninety-seven pages of smiling, happy doggies!	2005-10-10

I am by know way one of these \\"literary masters,\\" but find it necessary to say the author of this novel is a talented writer, who portray's her characters in a way that will touch the reader.

Like others, i was not blown away by FC when I read it -- the first time.  But last month when time was ticking down to the publishing date for Breath of Snow and Ashes, i thought i would give it a re-read (normally i start the entire series over again, but i think i can resite most of the first few books by now...) I have to say, reading Fiery Cross the 2nd time -- i actually liked it much better than the first time.  I felt i got more out of it and it led me right into this book, so i am glad i re-read it.  <br />   <br />Breath of Snow and Ashes was great, and as others have said nearly as good as the first books.  I enjoyed Brianna coming into her own as a woman and her struggle to keep some the 20th century in her life.   It was good to see some excitement again with Claire and see Jamie continue to show his love and commitment.   I was very glad to see Ian back, he too is one of my favorite characters.    <br /> <br />The growth in Roger was some of the best part of the book and clever on Ms Gabaldon's part because it happened casually and deep into the book, you recognized he was finally comfortable in the past and has started to become Jamie's equal well, except maybe in the love scenes.. but what are you gonna do, Jamie and Claire are pushing 60, how much more bodice ripping can they do? <br /> <br />I purposely did not read any reviews until after i finished the book, so it was mixed feelings for me when it ended -- glad there was more, but kind of miffed as i read it til nearly the end believeing this was the last book.  Like others, i kept waiting for sample scenes i had read on line over the last couple of years.   But, ok the trade off of 1 or 2 more books -- totally worth it.   <br /> <br />Thank you Ms Gabaldon for a great read, thanks for tieing up some loose ends and bringing us right up to the Revolution, very clever.  Claire knows it is coming, Jamie knows it coming and we know it is coming.  Now I cant wait tosee who they meet along the way to freedom.  Make it happen soon!!	2005-10-12

US	51277244	R1K7UYQMSBR6H5	0060753226	657787398	Buddha Baby	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Strong second half	This is the story of Lindsey Owyang, the Chinese, San Franciscan heroine of Keltner's previous book, The Dim Sum of All Things. Lindsey has two jobs, one at a museum gift shop and the other at the Catholic school she attended as a child. She also has a loving boyfriend named Michael, who spends most of the book at a vegan retreat. He's doing an expose for the magazine he works for, called Vegan Warrior. <br /> <br />While Michael is away, Lindsey finds herself drawn to Dustin Lee, one of the few other Chinese students at her Catholic elementary school. Dustin left the school after sixth grade (one of the nuns had a crush on him and kept pulling him onto her lap), and she hadn't seen him since. Now he's back in town and looking pretty hot, with a motorcycle. Lindsey's suddenly wondering why she's never dated an Asian guy. Dustin, in turn, has only dated white women. <br /> <br />In another subplot, Lindsey starts to wonder about her cranky grandmother's past when she finds some photos in the basement at her school. After some visits with her grandfather and one of the current students at the school, she pieces together some answers. <br /> <br />The first half of the book is a little disjointed. Before Dustin appears on the scene, and Lindsey starts investigating her grandmother's past, there is really no suspense or dramatic question to drive the plot forward, and readers may find themselves putting the book down. But the second half of the book moves right along, as the reader will want to find out whether Lindsey gives in to the temptation of Dustin. <br /> <br />The book also has some interesting observations. Lindsey talks about \\"Angry Asian Men\\" who give her attitude because she dates white men (her boyfriend is a quarter Chinese, but no one can tell from his appearance). However, the book is a little heavy-handed in its treatment of Catholic school; one of the nuns tells Lindsey that the school is much improved, and \\"now only practices mild corporal punishment\\". <br /> <br />Overall, this is a fun, interesting book that picks up considerably in the second half. If you enjoyed The Dim Sum of All Things, you will probably enjoy this book as well.	2005-10-13

China's exports - shoes, toys, clothing, tools, electronics and, more recently, cars and computers - have flooded the world market. China's trade surplus with the U.S. is climbing steadily, now more than $150 billion each year.  <br /> <br /> It is all the more remarkable that China's growth has been presided over by the same Communist Party that brought famine and social chaos in the 1960s and '70s. Now party and military leaders take part in the country's most profitable businesses. Nationalist pride is surging.  <br /> <br /> All of this raises an obvious question: What does China's emergence mean for the United States? Can China replace America as the world's dominant superpower? Ted C. Fishman sets out to explain how China will do just that. Fishman's argument is essentially that China, fueled by a huge labor market and preternatural ingenuity, is an unstoppable power that will bury the United States unless we reinvent ourselves. It is a simple theory, badly dwarfed by its flaws.  <br /> <br /> Fishman, a journalist and former commodities trader, falls blind to the innumerable obstacles China faces, like the weak rule of law, the endemic corruption and the highly politicized nature of its organizations. Fishman is ultimately unable to cut through the China mystique that has bamboozled businessmen since the 1800s. His reasoning is consistently superficial, and he is prone to grand-sounding pronouncements that are actually quite meaningless, like \\"the fact is that no matter what the Chinese machine produces for the Chinese themselves, the country's impact on the globe will inevitably and profoundly influence global life nonetheless.\\" It is tempting to dismiss this book as a flimsy economic treatise. Yet China's genuinely fast growth and its history of drastic change are compelling reasons to look more closely at the situation. Besides, the mind-set that Fishman embraces is dangerously popular with lawmakers in Washington. Indeed, Fishman's book will probably appeal most to those looking for a long-term enemy. For nativists who fear outsourcing - \\"exporting America\\" is what CNN's Lou Dobbs calls it - this book will reinforce an emotional belief that China is undermining our prosperity. A clear-eyed look suggests otherwise.  <br /> <br /> China's current boom began in the countryside, when farmers began ignoring old quota systems in the late 1970s and instead keeping money from surplus crops. China had been so battered by political turmoil and poverty that allowing a teardrop of capitalism might lighten the Communist Party load of trying to feed and house a billion poor people. The teardrop became a stream in the 1980s and then a river in the 1990s. As prosperity flushed coastal cities, more than 100 million farmers came clamoring for factory and construction jobs, and Chinese society was transformed from a rigid totalitarian state into a chaotic authoritarian one with major export muscle.  <br /> <br /> These days, leaders struggle to keep up with an economy surging beyond their control. There is no master plan directing money flow; it follows the market, inefficiently, with big bureaucratic eddies and sinkholes. The party still controls politics and has been so adept at co-opting Chinese businesspeople that no potential opposition has emerged. Yet party control over the lives of Chinese people is steadily diminishing.  <br /> <br /> It's a remarkable story. Unfortunately, Fishman cannot bring it to life. He appears to have visited several Chinese cities, but his descriptions of people and place are cardboard thin. As for his prescription for Americans, Fishman suggests better education and more study of Chinese. Hardly an original idea. And a far cry from \\"reinventing\\" ourselves.  <br /> <br /> So what about that \\"China threat\\"? It is a myth. China's economy is likely to keep growing and expand into realms like information management and software design. Trade and overseas investment will expand. A measure of freedom will continue to exist. The U.S. will continue to have persistent disputes with China over intellectual property, human rights, Tibet, Taiwan. But the reality remains that China is a moderately poor country with an uncertain political system and an ill-equipped military. It is growing fast, predominantly because it started from such a low base. Becoming a rival superpower? Nope.	2005-10-13

When I picked up \\"The Heart of a Teacher\\" I expected more of the usual teacher gift books that grace my shelf (and sometimes my trash can ;-).

US	12598621	R3TDBGIER1VF8Q	0061097497	113337875	Other Worlds	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Speculation Wrapped In Fiction	In this novel, Barbara Michaels uses the device of a club in Victorian London populated by (the ghosts of?) Harry Houdini, Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle, and others who gather to discuss famous paranormal cases. The men in the club ponder all the known facts about the matters and then offer their opinions as to the nature of the events. In some cases the noted gentlemen argue that the cases were fraud and in others that genuine preternatural forces were at work.<br /><br />The two incidents covered in Other Worlds were the infamous Bell Witch haunting of antebellum Tennessee, and a less famous but in some ways more shocking case--equally grounded in fact--of a New England family of the mid-1800's, whose home was seemingly invaded by a very creepy poltergeist phenomenon that begins making strange, eerie noises, moves on to rearranging furniture (while the family is IN the home) and from there proceeds from creating menacing \\"dolls\\" of each family member, twisted and shaped out of articles of the family's clothing. The case, inexplicably forgotten today except in the most scholarly of paranormal journals, reaches a crescendo I won't give away here but which surely, if true, reveals something stunning about what we hold to be reality.<br /><br />This book seems to have frustrated some because it does not conclusively debunk or confirm these cases, it tells the details as they are known, composes some possible explanations, and then lets the reader form her own views. I think many wanted a revelation along the lines of \\"this is how it happened\\". And of course that's impossible.<br /><br />This is a fun book for those who have an interest in events that fall outside what we like to feel are \\"everyday mundane\\" and its literary tone makes a nice touch considering the period the stories took place in.	2005-10-10

His conversion became pretty big news within my community because of the fact that he was a Catholic Priest from the east coast who became converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints after researching material to write an anti-Mormon book.  I actually had the opportunity to attend a meeting where he rehearsed his conversion story, and even had enough forethought to ask Deseret Book, an LDS publishing company, to record his talk to be sold in-stores (why not turn a profit on both sides of the religious debate since you are already a turncoat anyway?).  I had the opportunity to meet Isaiah, and he was very charismatic.   <br /> <br />During this talk he unequivocally denied the veracity of Catholicism, and embraced the doctrine and culture of the LDS faith.  His talk came out on tape and everybody in the area bought it (my friend actually bought mulitple copies and gave me one, which I still have for comic relief).  Two years later, after being a fully active Mormon, he left the church.  Not surprisingly, he then came out with a series of anti-Mormon books.   <br /> <br />One point of interest is that during his talk he said he started investigating Mormonism to find better anti-Mormon fodder, since most comments or supposed dogmas have been recycled by these types of writers, often for more than a century.  <br /> <br />There is no doubt that his entire foray into Mormonism was to try to leverage some credibility, which he has clearly done since all of his books since that time point out that he is a Mormon-turned-Catholic (they often leave out the fact that he was originally a Catholic).  This man is all-for-profit, and his claims of Mormonism in this book and others are still just the same old recycled trash that has been promulgated over the years.   <br /> <br />Take a pass on this and read something that actually makes people more Christlike.

Giangregorio, Mikko Hrmeinen and Keith Bonn; and, Weapons Tables by Hugh Foster and Keith Bonn.   <br />As Glantz points out in the introduction, the four year struggle ranged over 600,000 square miles and killed tens of millions of soldiers and civilians. He contends that the very size of the Eastern Front War makes it difficult to comprehend it in detail and therefore to place it in context of the Russian contribution to overall victory and this is why this book is such a valuable addition to the literature on the war.  Slaughterhouse places a great deal of information and succinct analysis in the reader's hands. <br />There is a wealth of data in this book, much of it technical.  Organizational tables show the composition of units down to brigade in some cases.  The Orders of Battle list all units from Army Group or Front down to division, along with date of activation, campaign history and successive commanders. As page after page rolls by in this section, 247 pages in fact, the reader can appreciate the massive scale of the conflict in the east. Every weapon used in the theater is listed in comparative tables which are comprehensive and easy to understand. Tanks, tank destroyers, all forms of small arms, all forms of artillery, assault guns, plus aircraft, including lend-lease air planes, appear side by side. Calibre, weight, rate of fire, range, crew, armor thickness, combat radius, speed, it is all here and as is typical of this well-researched book, many photographs of the weapons as well.  <br />Especially useful is the annotated chronology with well-placed maps which, in forty-five pages, provides the reader with an overview of the campaigns. Glantz sees the Battle of  Stalingrad as the decisive turning point of the war.  With regard to relative contributions to victory, Glantz's use of statistics demonstrates that even after the Normandy landings over sixty per cent of the German Army was still in the East and over sixty per cent of its losses as well.  <br />Glantz discusses also the role of Lend-Lease to the Soviets in the Allied victory. He determines that of the matriel the West delivered to the Soviet Union, vehicles, particularly trucks (55% of all used and 42% of jeeps), locomotives and rail cars, contributed most by logistically aiding Red Army offensives. If the Soviets had not received this assistance, he adjudges, it would have taken them 12 to 18 months longer to defeat the Germans.   <br />In the last chapter, Forgotten Battles, Glantz identifies several neglected operations which deserve research.  Here Glantz returns to one of his themes, namely that in order for a proper understanding of the war in the east, more must be known about the numerous counteractions the Red Army undertook during German offensives.  This is particularly so at the strategic level where the main question for Glantz is, to what extent did Stavka co-ordinate them and if so, what did the counteractions contribute to subsequent Soviet failures or successes.  <br />I found the biographical sketches of the senior officers very helpful and informative, especially the thirty-four Soviet portraits of commanders who are little known to the western reader or the Oxford Companion to World War II which has only 14. The book has a large select bibliography, a listof the finding aids for the captured German military documents at the National Archives, and a list of reliable websites.   <br />There is no better way to immerse oneself in the biggest and deadliest front of the war and to come away with informed insight than to read this book. <br />	2005-10-13

For the one year when I lived on campus during my undergraduate days, I had a next-door neighbour with whom I played chess, and whenever he would take a piece, he would issue his war-cry, 'Blood!'  How could I not purchase this book when I saw the title?<br /><br />Edward Lasker (1885-1981), an American chess champion, may have been related to Emanuel Lasker (1868 - 1941), who was the second official World Chess Champion, a title he held for 27 after claiming it from Wilhelm Steinitz.  The term of 27 years as champion is still a record.  Edward Lasker played a famous game against Emanuel Lasker, which is recorded in this book in detail with commentary.<br /><br />This is not a how-to manual specifically, although one will get many tips, particularly about combinations, end-game set-ups, and general strategy ideas.  Edward Lasker brings in many historic games and show their strategies, and does so in both sections.  The section on 'Chess for Blood' goes into more detail about major games and master play, but even here the focus is on strategy and psychology, albeit of a different sort.  At the highest level, chess ceases to be a game (much like professional sports) - 'Such games are no fun, even for the winner.  They are the hardest work imaginable.  You play for blood!'  Lasker in this section shows a move-by-move recreation of some of his own games, giving not only insight to the chess but also into the state of mind, the psychological aspects, of what goes on during a high level chess match.<br /><br />This is indeed interesting, but the better part of the book for all but the most obsessive of chess players is the first, in which Lasker looks at the hobby aspect of chess (well, perhaps not entirely hobby).  He looks at the history of sportsmanship, good and bad, such as the sixteenth century text that advocated that the chess player try to put the sun in the eyes of his opponent as a distraction.  Lasker explores the makings of a good chess player, which includes (in no particular order) memory, mathematical skill, concentration, creativity, and artistry.<br /><br />While there are definite strategies and tactics in chess (it does sound like war, and with elements such as knights, pawns, and other military features, it makes sense to think of chess in terms of martial imagery), there is no particular science that always leads to the same outcome.  'The general laws of chess strategy are surprisingly simple and few in number.  In fact, they can almost be reduced to one single principle which might be termed the principle of mobility.'  How this principle is used, however, it dependent upon the psychology and personal taste of the player.  Lasker makes chess-playing ability out to be similar to music, where there are definitely guidelines, but also enormous range for individual style.<br /><br />This is a very personal book in many ways.  Lasker was a concentration camp survivor from the second world war, and credits chess with helping him to get through the ordeal.  When he arrived in England after the war, he was tired and seasick, and spoke no English, but did find a chess game (and he recounts this game, which he won, in a move-by-move exposition here, too).  Lasker's tale is interesting, as much chess as his own life here.<br /><br />Lasker includes a complete listing of the International Chess rules, well worth having.  The notations throughout the book are standard to chess books, and Lasker's love of the game comes through very clearly, from a boyhood obsession to a lifelong avocation that becomes a true calling.<br /><br />Check!ngs of a good chess player, which includes (in no particular order) memory, mathematical skill, concentration, creativity, and artistry.

The basic premise behind Mine Yoshizaki's SGT FROG manga is this: froglike alien Sgt. Keroro and his extraterrestrial compatriots, in a failed attempt to conquer Pokopen (the Earth), find themselves stranded in the company of two Pokopenian siblings, Fuyuki and Natsumi Hinata, and their friends and family. Hilarity ensues. There you go. That's the series - beyond that there is no real coherent plot. But that's not particularly important, because the fact is a complex storyline isn't required for madcap comedy of this order. <br /> <br />The best comparison you can draw to Sgt. Frog is probably to Pinky & the Brain: overloaded with pop culture (Japanese anyway) allusions and socio-political send-ups, our protagonist conjures up preposterous scheme after preposterous scheme, to no avail. Another easy comparison would be with Invader Zim. The biggest difference between Sgt. Frog and these others, however, is the ensemble size: while P&B revolved around the clashing personalities of the title characters, and Invader Zim a team of four or so, Sgt. Frog is propelled by a stable cast of about a dozen unique, distinctly off-the-wall personalities.  <br /> <br />There's Natsumi Hinata, for instance, the Pokopenian teen whose authoritative hot-headedness remains the biggest obstacle on the path to invasion - apart from Sgt. Keroro himself, equal parts inept interstellar conqueror and freeloading plastic Gundam model fanatic. Then there's Natsumi's younger brother Fuyuki, a quiet, introverted kid with a keen interest in the occultm or Momoka Nishizawa, the insecure heiress to a worldwide fortune with a keen interest in Fuyuki. Not to mention Private Tamama, one of the Sgt.'s fellow-invaders, whose adorable exterior belies a violent split personality; the ditzy Lady Angol Moa, sent to Earth by her father the universal Lord of Terror to destroy it, but diverted by Keroro's misadventures; and many more. <br /> <br />The various plots, goofy and overblown as they are, make full use of the characters' interpersonal chemistry. For instance: when the School Sports Festival rolls around, athletic Natsumi petitions mom Aki to join her in the child-parent activities. But Aki is unable to attend due to her demanding career as a manga editor, which causes her to be gone most of the time anyway. Natsumi is forlorn by yet another absence, and while Keroro schemes to stand in for Mom Hinata in an attempt to put Natsumi in his debt, Corporal Giroro, whose hard-boiled shell hides a monstrous affection for the girl, has other plans. Meanwhile, Fuyuki suffers from a lack of self-confidence living in his sister's athletic shadow, and wealthy Momoka's attempts to aid his cause at the Festival, like having her bodyguards tranquilize the other racers, are sweet but probably misguided. That's just a sampling, from one of the tamer chapters at that - the insanity quotient is generally far more in excess. <br /> <br />Many of the installments have sensitive undercurrents: unrequited love, the clash between friendship and duty, jealousy, emotional insecurity, family dynamics, and so on. But there's something of overanalyzing in that evaluation, because any pyschological underpinnings involved are offset by copious coatings of over-the-top illustration, harebrained scenarios, laugh-out-loud hilarious gags, and unforgettably zany characters. Be forewarned: in spite of Keroro and Company's admitted adorability it's not for kiddies - there's enough sexual suggestion here to border on ecchi at times. But it's all in fun, and if you have a well developed sense of the absurd, as I like to put it, Sgt. Frog is as good n' silly as it gets.	2005-10-09

It's actually a hybrid, two stories in one, but only one of them is good.  <br />In the good one, the author tells-in standard English-of her epic battle to stop chemical companies from polluting the Gulf Coast waters that she and her neighbors had fished for generations.  <br />In the bad story she tells us-in polluted English-about herself, using an ungrammatical persona that seems an affectation aimed at being perceived as a pugnacious, in-your-face, don't-mess-with-me woman.  <br />Too bad. She's an interesting, courageous woman in her own right, with no need of affectation. Almost alone, she took on the big corporations who with impunity were ravaging her Gulf Coast environment, spilling huge toxic wastes into land, sea and air with criminal disregard for public health, worker safety, state and federal regulations, and in general all God's creatures. These corporate behemoths were able to rape the environment because their deep pockets had bought compliance among venal local officials, political influence from Texas to Washington, D.C., and their hiring power and big payrolls silenced the easily cowed.  <br />The only person they couldn't silence or buy off was Diane Wilson, whose story is a model of how to fight both city hall and Goliath and win, and is a tribute to her grit and pluck.    <br />But why the author laces her story with such graceless prose is puzzling, and why the publisher let her do it that way defies understanding. Listed on the copyright page are the names of a Chelsea Green editor, a managing editor, a copy editor, and a proofreader, all of whom presumably worked with this manuscript.  <br />Did none of them know that bad writing in a good cause is not nearly as effective as good writing in a good cause? Did none of them know that a double negative actually says the opposite of what the speaker intended and that, in any case, nothing is gained for any cause by a disingenuous use of clumsy and ignorant speech?  <br />Didn't they notice that Miss Wilson told the story of her fight in standard English, but the story of how she felt about the fight in another English altogether, one that sounded too ignorant to have come from the same person who told the first story? <br />Maybe not. Dust-jacket copy bills the book as \\"a novelistic tale,\\" and Chelsea Green's specialty is environmental activism, not fiction. Anyhow, here's a sampling of Ms. Wilson's writing that somehow passed muster with an intelligent writer and escaped an editor's pencil, too: <br />\\"Doomsday don't always stay doomsday.\\" <br /> \\"I had ran out of answers.\\" <br />\\"So the coffee got drank and a jarful of candy got ate . . . `  <br /> Then there's the just plain bad writing: <br />\\". . . panic clambered through my body worse than two babies running through the hall . . .\\" <br />\\". . . he wasn't no dandelion tiptoeing around the issues.\\" <br />\\". . . the sun laid a heavy hand on her hair.\\" <br />\\". . . his tone was still as feverish as a preacher with a message scribbled in his pocket.\\" <br />On the plus side, here's one of the few good ones: Describing oystermen who filed in after a long day at sea to sign her petition, Ms. Wilson wrote, \\"They looked tired-as if the wind and the cold had blown out the light in their eyes.\\"    <br />A similar cold front must have moved through the editorial offices of Chelsea Green Publishing Company in White River Junction, Vermont, while An Unreasonable Woman was being prepped for press. Green River (and Ms. Wilson) should stick to straight-forward reporting from the environmental front.  <br />True-life experiences can be novelized with great effect. Truman Capote and Norman Mailer proved that with, respectively, In Cold Blood and The Executioner's Song. But they didn't pick an ignorant-sounding narrator to tell the tale.	2005-10-13

How they made it to a new land still amazes me. <br /> <br />This book is so fantastic and amazing. It just brings the year 1848 to life all over again. Great job Christina Gregory!! Keep up the great writing!!	2005-10-13

It was writen in the 1960's and you can definetly tell.  Alot has changed since then.  It wasn't like he was a student and wrote the book about his own feelings towards school. Holt was a school teacher that had alot of his own ideas about why students didn't do things or said certian things or even why they \\"failed\\".  Everything he said was long and drawn out. There were many pointless stories of his exact teachings. It was like he recoreded it and put it word for word in his book.  We don't recommend this to anyone that has their own mind.  But good luck on getting into it, if you decide to read this waste of time.	2005-10-13

I have fallen in love with handpainted yarns and this books offers some great ideas for their use. The patterns are great and the photography is wonderful. Best of all it includes many patterns for men in 1x and 2x. Being a guy with a large frame I am continuosly upset with pattern designers who only offer a smattering of male patterns and those are usually for men of slight frame. I also like color in my garments and most male patterns are dark solid colors. This book offers a new look at using colors for any gender. I don't know where one of the previous posters saw all the fair isle. It does include some, but the majority of patterns use color in a variety of other ways. Oh, it also has a lot of great patterns for women.	2005-10-14

These characters are earthy and real, common folk with endearing foibles and vulnerabilities.  Schaffert breathes life into his characters with a delicate touch, lending a<br /><br />poignant dignity to even the oddest misfit.<br /><br />Hud Smith writes mournful country songs and drinks more than he should.  He lives above the shoe repair shop on the square in a fading Nebraska town but dreams of reconciling with his ex-wife, Tuesday.  Every dream he ever had has fallen through, but despite his dreary life, Hud faces every day with hope and humor.  He plays piano and sings at a nearby Ramada, fending off lonely women who find his music appealing, living for the day his family will be restored.<br /><br />Tuesday's mothering skills are somewhat lacking.  She barely<br /><br />has the energy and drive to supervise their eight year old daughter, Nina. Nina is an irrepressible child who sings off key and makes up graceless dance steps.  Whatever Nina does, Hud finds adorable and brilliant.  He adores his quirky daughter and imagines stealing her away from Tuesday to<br /><br />keep her with him all the time.  Their seventeen year old son Gatling has run away from home to play guitar and sing backup with The Daughters of God, an iconic Christian rock group.  Nina is all Hud and Tuesday have left to remind them of a marriage that once brought joy.  All three dream of having<br /><br />Gatling back home where he belongs and set off in a borrowed schoolbus to find him.<br /><br />Circulating around this mismatched threesome are an equally strange mix of friends, neighbors, and churchgoers who speak their own dark language.  The story is often humorous, but is not a cruel parody of life's rejects.  These are lives made up of large and small failures, joys, and negotiations.  And Schaffert makes them shine.  Highly recommended.	2005-10-10

I, personally, find the occult fascinating. I have studied various aspects of it intensely for the last 8 years. This book, however, is not intended for someone as well read as I on the topic. <br /> <br />I pointed this book out to my girlfriend in a bookstore, as she wanted to develop a basic understanding for Magick and the occult that has become a central fascination in my life. This book is ideal for that purpose: educating the layperson. It is a book written in simple terms that only lightly touches on the topics contained in its pages. It contains purely factual information, although, some of it, particularly those involving Satanism and Satan, take on a Judeo-Christian biased slant. However, as these are RECORDED by the church, they still must be acknowledged as fact, regardless of validity. <br /> <br />This book also functions well as an immediate, concise reference, but by all means, as with any reference, seek more material. <br />	2005-10-09

The reviewer is a member of the Northern Virginia Ethical Society, a religious Humanist congregation.   <br /> <br />There are so many problems with the book they would be difficult to list.  The bibliography shows the author made unfortunate choices for sources, such as books by fellow evangelicals and conservatives for information about Humanism rather than primary sources or more scholarly texts.  The book has an amazingly incoherent organizational structure.  No scholar himself, Howse stumbles from the introduction, where is mis-defines Humanism, and quickly proceeds downhill from there. <br /> <br />The first chapter scattershots at several minor issues, but the aim point is the claim that America was founded as a Christian nation, and that Liberals and Humanists kicked God out of schools and the public square.  Howse appears not to have understood why our constitution called for secular governance.  This reviewer recommends \\"The Godless Constitution\\" by Isaac Kramnick and R. Laurence Moore to those readers interested in this issue. <br /> <br />The second chapter claims that separation of Church and State is a \\"liberal lie\\" and a modern creation.  Howse claims that states may institute official state religions notwithstanding the Fourteenth Amendment, apparently not considering that possibility that Utah, a Mormon majority state could, under his arguement, mandate all voters to be LDS members.  Howse also seems to believe that Liberals and Humanists initiated most cases involving prayer in schools.  In fact, it has always been religious minorities-Catholics, Jews, Mormons and other devout people who started the cases, and in whose behalf the government has correctly sided.  I direct readers who are interested in this topic to \\"Between Church and State,\\" by James W. Fraser. <br /> <br />The nadir of the book is the next two chapters dealing with Humanism and Liberalism. Howse makes sometimes bizarre assertions, including: true Republicans must be Christians fundamentalists and that Liberals are anti-Christian.  Like many  conspiratorialists, Howse props up both John Dewey and the NEA for exposure as Humanists and Socialists aiming to brainwash children.  These claims are terribly out of date considering the Department of Education and many local school boards are under control of Christian conservatives.   <br /> <br />Then there is a chapter on Evolution, a chapter claiming secular humanism is the state religion, and so on. Edited in a cut-and-paste manner, the sections are oftimes wrong and oftimes not relevant to the topic.    <br /> <br />Howse doesn't know the histories or definitions of Humanism, Liberalism, Marxism, Secularism or any other \\"ism\\" he uses, and therefore conflates one with the other.  All things that are not approved by his evangelical worldview are liberal, or socialistic or secular or humanistic (which he believes are all the same).  Never one to seek out new and better sources, he relies upon Tim LaHaye for much of his history of Humanism.  This is equivalent to using a Wahhabist to explain Judaism. <br /> <br />Howse makes much of the assertion that Humanism is a religion, but like LaHaye, he doesn't understand that there are diverse views on this point even within the Humanist community.  I'm a religious Humanist, part of the Ethical Culture movement that has been recognized as a religion for over one hundred years.  Paul Kurtz is a Secular Humanist. Some Secular Humanists reject the religious connotation, believing religion has only furthered discord, bigotry and prejudice.  Howse has provided more evidence to support their view.  Indeed, it is almost impossible to see how someone who claims to follow the Prince of Peace could have written a book so filled with error and venom.   <br /> <br />If you are an evangelical Christian or a conservative, I do not recommend this book.  It is filled with falsehoods and omissions.  Aside from the books cited in the review, I would recommend \\"The Humanist Way\\" by Edward L. Ericson, or visits to the American Humanist Association website ([...]) and American Ethical Union ([...]  But better yet, find a local Ethical Society or secular humanist group to visit, and talk with its members.  You will not agree with our views, but you will also find people completely different from those depicted in these pages.  We are not your enemies; we are your fellow citizens. <br /> <br />The book contains no photographs, endnotes but no bibliography, four appendices (non useful to the reader and containing errors) and no index.	2005-10-11

This book is a little dragging in the middle, but the ending is fantastic with the promise of a sequel attracting more readers. <br /> <br />This book starts with Silas Heap finding a baby girl with violet eyes in the snow.

Silas Heap's seventh son, Septimus Heap, disappears on the same night Silas finds the princess. <br /> <br />Named Jenna, the princess grows up with no knowledge of her royal past until she goes on the run from the Assasins.

His writing not only is in good English, but it's good writing! The story takes place in the spring of 1989, in China. Obviously, the reader is in a state of mounting suspense awaiting the eyewitness description of the massacres at Tiananmen Square which occurred on June 3-4. Ha Jin writes of these and of everyday things--food preparation, clothing styles, ancient poems, songs, and political events, as only a native Chinese could. His narrator, a graduate student at a provincial university, experiences the horrors of tending a deranged stroke patient--his professor and mentor--and hears the recollections the older man dredges up about the Cultural Revolution, a time of book-burning, persecution, and debasement of all intellectuals by the regime. There are also several side plots involving romance and political advancement at the expense of merit, a crude form of cronyism with which we are familiar in our own country.<br /><br />Ha Jin has managed to write in a style that reads as though it is a translation from Chinese to English, but obviously he wrote the book in English.

This is not the definitive account of the 1906 quake but the account of what Mr. Winchester found to be interesting -- fortunately it is interesting for the reader too.    The book is a wonderful geology book for the non-science reader as Mr. Winchester lays out why the quake occurred where it occurred (see the maps within) with vignettes with the fallout from the quake. He also makes clear that the next San Francisco earthquake is just down the road and we are no more prepared for that one either. The book cover itself is innovative and almost worth the price of the book.

When one looks over the vast array of American Literature, there are but a few books that are ranked in a class by themselves.  They include such novels as \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\", \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", and \\"The Jungle\\".  In any \\"greatest list\\" I've seen, \\"Moby Dick\\" always shows up.  In fact, only Huckleberry Finn draws more support as the Great American Novel.  With this in mind, I decided that it was high time I read \\"Moby Dick\\".  In doing so, I was prepared to appreciate a classic with my only misgivings being my tendency to get bogged down in the tedium of the 19th Century style of prose.   <br /> <br />I admit that I was fairly satisfied with the first part of the novel and I was proceeding along fine until Ismael turned into the world's greatest authority on the subject of whales and whaling.  I may have missed a point or two but I was sure that Ismael's self-introduction identified him as a merchant marine who was embarking on on his first whaling voyage.  He must have been doing a lot of reading on the voyage because he proceeded to tell me more that I ever wanted to know about whales and whaling. <br /> <br />I read \\"Moby Dick\\" to enjoy a story; not to engorge myself with, for me, uninteresting trivia.  The facts overwhelmed the story and I was losing interest fast.  I finally started to speed read my way through the final 50 pages and all of the accompanying \\"Billy Budd\\".  I have seldom been so happy to finish a book and I even entertained the thought of just chucking the book and not even finishing it.  I realize that there are many thousands of people out there for whom the sea is an enchantress.

Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Drafts 1-38: Toll (Wesleyan, 2001)<br /><br />I've (ironically) put down a number of drafts of this review, and haven't come up with anything remotely satisfying. There's really not much I have to say about the book; it's overlong (though from what I have been able to gather it's only the first two sections of a larger, as yet unfinished, work), close to unintelligible in places, full of parallel text branching off the main piece with no stage direction as to how a reader is supposed to read said parallel text, and drops out of what poetic mode it has in places and becomes didactic (\\"Deixis\\" is the most blatant example of this). All of this leads to a simple \\"didn't like it much.\\" Nothing else to be said, I guess. **	2005-10-11

This incident lasts for 100 pages as Kafka describes the moments and thoughts going through the poor mutated man's mind.

Note the ISM.  This is not about global trade or global economics but rather about the ISM that commands that these are inevitable and must take priority over national security, quality of life, job security, law and order. <br /> <br />For 30 years academicians have worked to undermine countries, including the USA itself, by demanding that such countries are obsolete.  As an American, I note that we are a country of laws and these folks worked to undermine law.  They worked to undermine democracy and choice.  They worked to convert the world to a single unelected government run by corporate cronies.  This is globalism. <br /> <br />Most have never heard of it.  Many will not believe it.  Yet this is no conspiracy theory or work of fiction.  This treason drove our politicians over the past decades thus producing in large part the ineffectual incompetencies of our leadership in that period.  It also drove the widespread attacks on the middle class and our quality of life. <br /> <br />The story is magnificent.  The book documents a wide range of little known fact and links them into the rise of neo-conservatism and neo-liberalism.   <br /> <br />I find the author's writing a bit forced, a bit ponderous, but the material is worth getting past his quirks.  Some bit of save-the-world ideology is also included, but must be in these kinds of treatise. <br /> <br />Buy it, read it, and then understand why your congressman and senator have sold you out, turned their back on Democracy, and become slaves to corporate corruption.

While there are various other books on this subject, this book gives, probably, one of the best, and most elegant account on the theory, particularly multivariate distribution theory, which is commonly encountered in applications. This book gives a definitive account of the techniques used to derive multivariate distributions, starting from R.A. Fisher, P L Hsu's work [[ASIN:0387907254 Pao-Lu Hsu: Collected Papers]], to modern developments of A T James, and others. This book is a must-read for anyone who ventures into research in multivariate statistics.

Instead of writing a highly sensationalised account, Mr. Stenn uses a lot of solid research and facts, not rehashing and keeping alive the same old trashy rumors and character assassinations.  He even disproves the most infamous urban legend of them all, the one about Clara and the USC football team.  What does emerge is the portrait of a very sad vulnerable tragic person.  Clara came from dirt-poor Brooklyn roots, with mental illness running in her family, moving often in childhood, picked on by her peers and terribly abused at home.  And like many abused children, she made excuses for it, believing they did it for her own good, that it was in her own best interest that her mother tried to kill her, that her father often beat her and once raped her.  Her luck really began changing when she went west and broke into movies, after winning a local talent contest at the age of sixteen, and for a time enjoyed a semblance of happiness.  However, her career began to decline in the early Thirties after a number of scandals (contrary to another urban legend, it wasn't really because of the coming of sound, although she did have a terrible case of microphone-phobia), and she finally left Paramount, feeling it in her own best interest.  During this time, she married Rex Bell, who for a time provided her with a very happy secure life, as well as the two sons she adored and tried to be the ideal mother to.  However, her past caught up with her and she eventually had to go to a number of doctors and psychiatrists, falling victim to the same schizophrenia that her mother and other female relatives had suffered from, and died at the relatively young age of sixty.<br /><br />It would be too easy for a biographer to paint a picture of Clara as a sleazy party-crazy bed-hopping woman of loose morals and ill repute who just got lucky, but Mr. Stenn instead paints a picture of a woman who was just a sweet scared vulnerable person who never really had a childhood, who just wanted love, security, and acceptance, and tried to get it in all of the wrong ways.  She deserved so much better than abusive parents, a manager who exploited her, a studio that rarely put her in anything but predictable formula pictures instead of more serious dramatic roles, a press that repeatedly made up disgusting allegations against her (whether of a sexual nature or not), people who still believe these ridiculous stories that were manufactured decades ago, and a society that didn't fully understand the schizophrenia she suffered from, the disease that fully began showing itself after she was no longer acting.man who was just a sweet scared vulnerable person who never really had a childhood, who just wanted love, security, and acceptance, and tried to get it in all of the wrong ways.

I found this book to be not quite as bad as some reviewers have, but not quite as good as it promised. It was definitely readable, and intriguing. There was a clever dual story which unfolded concerning the royal confectioner, Miss Cornwallis, who crafted 'subtleties' for the royal court and of course, Anne Boleyn. The parallel story of the confectioner was actually more interesting to me than the Anne Boleyn story. The author does a good job of making  characters such as musician Mark Smeaton 'real' and not not footnotes of history. Her treatment of Queen Anne, to which most reviewers seem to object, is not overly sympathetic--neither is is particularly crass. The author explains in the endnotes the use of names such as Tom and Tommy, for Cromwell and Cranmer, as a way to help distinguish their personalities. This is presuming that Anne would not have referred to either of them in her diary notes by their surnames.  The storyline is uneven...I was never 100 percent sure if the two tales were entirely parallel..but it does provide an interesting perspective as to the roles of the Queen and the commoner/confectioner.  If you're looking for a book highly sympathic to Anne Boleyn, this isn't it. Neither is it anti-Anne. Suzannah Dunn has done an interesting job of trying to make Anne contemporary in thought and in feel.  Perhaps that is the problem. Her times--the roles of women, the 'chivalry and romance' of her time, do not translate to the current day. Worth a read? Yes, I think so. The author is definitely a talented storyteller. As I can attest, you can't tell anyone what to write--had she done a novel strictly about the confectioner, and tied that in to her times and the Court of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, it might have been received better. Still, definitely a good read, for a novelization about Anne's 'diary' and memories. Keep in mind that excellent novels, such as The Lady in the Tower, are already out there. If you're like me, and always looking for something 'new' to read about Anne of the Thousand Days, you will probably find this book of interest. Could it have been better? With 20/10 hindsight, yes, of course. Still, it's a well researched, nicely written novel.ng 'new' to read about Anne of the Thousand Days, you will probably find this book of interest.

The 4th edition covers C# / .NET 2.0 which introduces many new features compared to 1.x (e.g. generics), and which is the standard platform for Visual Studio 2005 developers. If you're a Visual Studio .NET 2003 developer, you'll need to upgrade (or download a beta version) in order to run some of the examples. This is a book about the C# language rather than .NET, so reading this book will not turn you into a proficient Windows/Web Forms programmer. However, it provides an essential foundation for further reading on more advanced .NET topics. Jesse Liberty writes in a fairly readable style, and I particularly liked the small sections contrasting the way C# does something with similar techniques in C++, Visual Basic and Java. Some of the code examples feel a bit verbose: several times the same long listing appears in full with minor changes between each version. The organization of the book also felt a little quirky, with important topics like streams and threads relegated to the back of the book, appearing after much more obscure discussions of marshalling and remoting. In general though, a good introduction to C# 2.0.	2005-10-09

I was disappointed.  The Mia Snow character is really irritating.  She's extremely violent, bad-tempered, undisciplined and would be a disgrace to any law enforcement agency (even a futuristic one).  Her alien love interest is a classy guy and it's beyond me what he sees in her, since she tries to beat him to a pulp repeatedly.  The romance isn't convincing at all. I also thought the primary storyline (alien babies) was hard to follow.	2005-10-11

Packed with color photos of both interior and exterior d&eacute;cor, Chinese Houses also presents an in-depth survey of the rituals, culture, ornamentation influences, and floor plans of homes across China, from urban to rural dwellings. If it's a strong in-depth history of Chinese home architecture which is desired, look no further than the gorgeous Chinese Houses: it's much more than the coffee table picturebook it appears a first glance.	2005-10-12

This monograph is the second to exhibit the work he has become famous for - a bare bones Northwest vernacular that owes as much to his Pennsylvania roots as it does to the Pacific Northwest.  It is readily apparent that Cutler studied under Louis Kahn in the exacting details he demands in all his projects.  He now has the luxury to pick and choose his clients which have include Bill Gates.  You get a small glimpse of the Gates estate in the Entry Turnaround in Medina, Washington.  He and Peter Bohlin worked on the project together, setting up a sawmill on the site to cut the recycled timber to their specifications.  As Cutler once said, I never look at the same detail twice, re-examining the methods and materials of construction anew in each project he undertakes.<br /><br />With the introduction of Bruce Anderson to the firm, he has begun to investigate pre-fabricated housing in the form of the Lindal Cedar Home, but you can see that it is the unique individual homes which he relishes.  He experimented with rammed-earth construction in the Residence at Meteor Vineyards in Napa Valley, creating a unique marbled finish; but it is projects like the Schmidt Residence that bear his signature in the intricate woodwork and metal connections.  This book provides you with a short but thorough look into several of the projects, illustrating that James Cutler is one of the leading architects of his generation.	2005-10-13

First of all, the book comes wrapped in plastic, so you can't check it out first - a real downside, I think. <br /> <br />It's a neat idea, and I'd hoped the book would be a real aid for knitting brainstorming and planning.  Unfortunately, it's heavily weighted towards the figure-outline design pages, which are only good for designing sweaters.  I'd like to have something to prompt accessory ideas, and more of the knitting-journal features.  There are only 12 spaces for \\"things I've made\\" entries, and a handful of \\"projects I want to knit\\" require a full page each. <br /> <br />The yarn inventory page is a neat idea, but, as previous reviewers have said, I don't know how well the book would handle having bits of yarn taped inside it. <br /> <br />The journal would be made much better with more project pages, and maybe some pages for a wish list without pictures.

It has been produced 3 times on Broadway.  The 1906 production starred Mrs. Fiske and Arliss Howard and ran for 60 performances.  Other revivals followed in 1915 and 1933.  As we approach the century mark on this comedy of manners, it's an interesting look back to see what's changed and what still plays.<br /><br />The premise is still most interesting.  It follows the adventures of two divorced couples.  Phillip Phillimore, a prominent New York judge, has divorced Vida whose unconventional flare for see-through gowns & forays in Egypt make her Bohemian.  Wealthy heiress Cynthia Karslake married lawyer and horse enthusiast John Karslake for love and divorced him quickly, dropping him like a hot potato.  Cynthia is preparing to marry Phillip Phillimore, a sensible match for her after the flaming passion of the previous marriage burned out.  Both Vida Phillimore & Jack Karslake are unattached.  Business each has before the judge brings them to his residence on the eve of his wedding.  Therefore you have the engaged and both ex's trading banter and quips in the drawing room.<br /><br />Complications arise when single Englishman Sir Wilfrid Cates-Darby enters.  His suave and easy way plays with the American women he's come to admire.  He develops an attraction to both Cynthia Karslake and Vida Phillimore.  Cynthia becomes quite jealous as Vida flirts with her ex, fanning a spark that has not entirely gone out.  On the day of the wedding, Cynthia allows herself to be taken to the track by Sir Wilfrid, delaying her 3 p.m. wedding to 9 p.m.  This goes over like a lead balloon to a cadre of outraged Phillimore relatives including sister Grace, aunt Miss Heneage, & cousin William Sudley.  Phillip's brother Matthew is a clergyman who has preached liberally on divorce and intends to perform the wedding ceremony.<br /><br />Finally in Act III all draw together for the wedding, only for Cynthia to realize that her jealousy about her ex is stronger than her desire to marry the judge.  The play climaxes in the final act as Jack Karslake's investigation into Cynthia's quickie divorce reveals legal flaws that result in the fact that they're still married.  Vida hooks up with Sir Wilfrid and marries quickly at the Karslake residence.  Cynthia shows up with Jack thinking she's married Phillimore and Cynthia thinking that Jack's married Vida.  Misunderstandings are resolved as Cynthia realizes that Karslake kept the room exactly as she left it on the day she walked out on him.  Their passion flares as Jack replaces his wedding ring on the willing Cynthia's finger.<br /><br />What's changed?  In 1906, divorce was doubtless regarded as more of a scandal than our present-day culture.  So the hubbub that surrounds two divorced couples seems quaint.  However, the raw emotions that ex's can hold for each other still plays well.  The numerous servants in the various households seem quaint as does the fact that Phillimore's house doesn't have electricity, but Karslake's does.  The language of the play is quite elevated with numerous words in the judge's dialogue being not in most people's normal vocabulary.  The action of the play still flows well and could work with strong leads.  Overall, it's an interesting comedy almost 100 years later.  Enjoy!for Cynthia to realize that her jealousy about her ex is stronger than her desire to marry the judge.

The big downside to these volumes is that they eventually split in half! However... I also own a stack of other film encyclopedias but for weight and manageability this is the best of the lot. The book is around 2 inches thick - but is the size of a novel and you can hold it in one hand. It is a full resource (with over 18,000 titles!), easy to carry around and has a full listing of directors and cast at the back along with Oscar winners. Overall the reviews are not very good and they are limited to just four of five lines at best. I mostly do not use it for the reviews though. It is more of a \\"find a director or star that you like and quickly flick through the index and the corresponding works to see what else they have done\\". For that it is very impressive but if you are looking for in-depth reviews then you should go elsewhere for the more unmanageable volumes and Arnold Schwarzenner to help carry them around for you.	2005-10-11

Olivia Calwell is newly married to the devastatingly handsome, somewhat secretive, and incredibly dashing Dane Calwell, Lord Greenleigh.  She finds great pleasure in his company, in the bedroom and out. Unfortunately he is a very busy man during the day.  He is usually away at meetings or locked in his study with his business advisor.<br /><br />Although she is falling helplessly in love with Dane, Olivia is very frustrated by her new husband's cryptic behavior.<br /><br />Dane Calwell, Lord Greenleigh, is a member of the Royal Four, men charged with protecting England and the Prince Regent in complete secrecy. Known as the Lion, Dane knows that his service to England is his foremost duty.  But the new Lady Greenleigh, Olivia, tempts him from his mission in ways he never expected.  Olivia is poised, intelligent and has a marvelous sense of humor.  While Dane appreciates Olivia's cleverness, he also laments this very trait for she is constantly questioning things.  If he isn't careful, her curiosity and intellect will interfere with his latest mission, putting Olivia in terrible danger. Can the Lion protect his country and his heart?<br /><br />I love these characters and I love their story. Olivia is sweetly awkward and delightfully funny. I especially love her fearless interaction with Dane, although, there were times I wanted to shake him senseless and wished Olivia would do it for me. But I forgave him, how could I not? For Dane is dutiful, noble, and oh, so sinfully gorgeous. Dane has me so enthralled that I am still drooling over him.<br /><br />Surrender to a Wicked Spy is a keeper! I knew I'd love this book when I giggled out loud in the very first chapter. Ms. Bradley's sense of humor always shines in her writing, but especially so in Surrender to a Wicked Spy. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of romance, intrigue and hot, delicious sex. And I cannot stress enough how delicious it is!

As he did in CONQUEST OF COOL and WHAT HAPPENED TO KANSAS, he examines the many self-serving narratives of the corporate state, showing how each story supports a pseudo-populist philosophy designed to whip up anti-elitist sentiments in order to better serve the interests of that elite.     Legitimacy, since the Great Crash, had, until fairly recently been a fairly daunting problem for business.  Now, as Frank points out, with the children of the Depression passing away, the corporatocracy and its junior partners in government have been emboldened to portray themselves as the heirs to Populism, Progressivism, and the New Deal, to advertise themselves as the vanguard of a revolutionary movement, a movement which through the millennial workings of the market is clearing the way for a new birth of freedom in the U.S.A., and throughout the world.      Frank notes, for instance, that throughout the 90s Americans were told that average working stiff could easily become the \\"millionaire next door,\\" and further, that the average guy was much better off owning stock than relying on his pension or Social Security to see him through his golden years.  So pervasive did this free market farrago become in the media, that even now, well after the New Economy bubble burst, many still hear it as gospel, believe that inevitably everything must be privatized.  So cunning has the pro-business rhetoric of the corporate state become that the average American blames himself for not being \\"entrepreneurial\\" enough, when instead Frank says he should be working to reverse the corporatocracy's 30-year rollback of worker's and citizen's rights.      A profoundly funny writer with a razor-sharp satiric edge, Frank will have you laughing out loud at the transparent self-serving cant of the corporatocracy and their handmaidens in the media, academia, and government.  Frank knows his history,and clearly sees through the latest lies of that great unregenerate beast, redder now in tooth and claw than ever before.	2005-10-12

This is a highly riveting account of the only FBI agent in history, Joe Pistone, ever to be proposed for membership in the mob. For six years Pistone worked and lived with made guys - hardcore mobsters who do not tolerate mistakes, idiots or rats (informers). This hard-hitting, real-world account takes you deep inside the thoughts, lives and actions of these individuals.  Some have reported that the language and descriptions within this book are too much.  This ain't Disneyland, ya know.  Pistone's writing style places you in the middle of the fire from the very first page and holds you there until the end. For his end, Pistone possesses nads of solid boron, one of the hardest metals known to mankind.  Second by second, for six long years, Pistone was in effect a mobster.  He stayed alive by his magnificent acting ability, fortitude and unadulterated guts.  In spite of the hardships for himself and his family, who he rarely saw during this time, he stuck it out to the very end when the FBI had to end the operation because Pistone was scheduled to make a hit.  The mob was caught off guard and there was indeed hell to pay.  My only complaint about this book is that it was not long enough.  I could have read on for days.	2005-10-10

It seemed that some of the reviewers took offence at the content and therefore gave it low ratings.  There was an extensive review by the F.A.R.M.S. group (Mormon apologetics supported and paid by Mormon institutions).  In the review it was very easy to see that the apologetics were afraid of the book, because rather than give evidence of the failings or shortcomings of the book, they attacked the books author with what appeared to be a thinly veiled character attack.  The other ratings presented were generally were very high.  This made the book more interesting to me as a Mormon. <br /> <br />I found the book a refreshing change from the books that are recommended by the Mormon Church.  The author presented primary source documentation to support almost every topic presented.  There were some sections where the author made certain suppositions and conjectures.  These were clearly identified as such. <br /> <br />In all, I felt the work was presented well, easy to read and factual.  It is a pity that the Mormon Church is so afraid of its members finding out about the \\"true\\" history of the roots of Mormonism.

As a devout reader of The New Yorker I was anxiously awaiting access to their archives for a long time only to be sadly disappointed by this effort.  I have relished in the treasure chest of past articles from the other great publications with New York titles: The Times and the NYRB.  This release by Random House is simply an embarrassment, with the only explanation for this clumsy version I can imagine was a corporate demand for a pre-holiday rollout.  The two prominent faults are both so glaring and unnecessary in this moment of refined technology.  The search feature is abysmal, providing only dates for a given search but no elucidation to what the result refers to.  By far the greatest flaw is the actual reading format.  The display is basically microfilm on a disc with ads and all.  It is nearly impossible to read on my monitor and is useless if one wants to print the article.  How the creators of this collection could have released it without a printer friendly option stretches all credulity.  David Remnick who has done a fine job shepherding the magazine for the past decade should be particularly shamed by this shocking failure of product.  The New Yorker has set the pace for literary standards for decades, now falls unceremoniously on its face with this release.  The publishers should issue a mass recall and produce a useable archive.  This being doubtful, I will do all that is left for a jilted lover to do: return my sadly disappointing copy.	2005-10-09

As we now see frightening signs of such faith-based extremism in its early forms beginning to take hold in the United States and we watch Europe engulfed in a clash of civilizations, it is in the interest of every world citizen to understand the phenomenon for what it is. Since September 2001 I have noticed more than the usual level of abuse of the phrases, \\"By God\\" and \\"Wallah.\\" It seems we are convinced whatever fleeting thought passes through our heads is a lightning bolt sent from upon high.<br /><br />Sir Winston Churchill understood fanaticism. The following is from his book \\"The River Wars\\":<br /><br />\\"Few facts are so encouraging to the student of human development as the desire, which most men and all communities manifest at all times, to associate with their actions at least the appearance of moral right. However distorted may be their conceptions of virtue, however feeble their efforts to attain even to their own ideals, it is a pleasing feature and hopeful augury that they should wish to be justified. The sufferings of a people or class may be intolerable, but before they take up arms and risk their lives some unselfish and impersonal spirit must animate them. In countries where there is education and mental activity or refinement, this high motive is found in the pride of glorious traditions or in a keen sympathy with surrounding misery. Ignorance deprives savage nations of such incentives. Yet in the marvelous economy of nature this very ignorance is a source of greater strength. It affords them the mighty stimulus of fanaticism. ... It [fanaticism] gives men something which they think is sublime to fight for, and this serves them as an excuse for wars which it is desirable to begin for totally different reasons. Fanaticism is not a cause of war. It is the means that helps savage peoples to fight. It is the spirit that enables them to combine -- the great common object before which all personal or tribal disputes become insignificant. What the horn is to the rhinoceros, what the sting is to the wasp, the Mohammedan faith was to the Arabs of the Sudan -- a faculty of offence or defense. It was all this and no more ... Those whose practice it is to regard their own nation as possessing a monopoly of virtue and common-sense, are wont to ascribe every military enterprise of savage peoples to fanaticism. They calmly ignore obvious and legitimate motives. The most rational conduct is considered mad. It is, perhaps, an historical fact that the revolt of a large population has never been caused solely or even mainly by religious enthusiasm.\\"<br /><br />So it is that men like Churchill can become great statesmen. They understand the tools by which populations are manipulated. The next time someone makes a pitch to you about your \\"desire to belong to something greater than yourself,\\" at least recognize the tool at work when you don your uniform, reach for your wallet, or offer up your sons and daughters as cannon fodder to ingrates on both sides of the gulf.ine -- the great common object before which all personal or tribal disputes become insignificant.

First, for a \\"reassessment\\" of eugenics, Lynn seems very fond of the original eugenic principles set forth by Sir Francis Galton over 100 years ago.  He dismisses several eugenic propositions set forth by more contemporary thinkers simply because they do not match with Galton's original ideas.  Furthermore, while Lynn includes a section on biotechnology, he seems to place little emphasis on its importance.     Secondly, as I suppose should be expected of a book about eugenics, Lynn places heavy emphasis on nature's influence on intelligence, health, and personality.  The standard stance in the social sciences is to accept nature and nurture as having a 50/50 influence on these factors unless there is compelling evidence to the contrary.  And while Lynn does attempt to make a case for favoring nature over nurture, his evidence is sometimes shoddy.  Lynn often asserts causation when he only presents a correlation and is prone to mixing his units of analysis (this is called the ecological fallacy in the social sciences).      Also, I found this book to be offensive (and inaccurate) in its classist nature.  Lynn writes of encouraging higher birth rates among the rich as if wealth is the same as genetic superiority.  While research shows that people of higher socioeconomic status are more likely to have better genes, higher IQs, etc, this is not absolute.  According to the APA Task Force report on intelligence, the correlation between parental SES and child's IQ is .33.  Any successful eugenics program would need a much better measure of genetic fitness than SES alone.    However, in spite of these failings, I do believe that \\"Eugenics: A Reassessment\\" is an important work for anyone who is interested in eugenics and its place in modern society.  Lynn must be given credit for attempting to defend eugenics at a time when such a stance is horribly unpopular.  And while this bookhas its weaknesses, Lynn does provide ample evidence that a) eugenics would be effective in improving IQ, reducing genetic birth defects, and increasing positive personality traits and b) many of us already support eugenics without knowing it.  Just a few examples of this include:    - Selective plant and animal breeding has been highly successful in producing 'superior' stock (insect resistant crops, higher yielding dairy cattle, etc).  Why should selective breeding of humans be any different?  - A multitude of studies on twins and adopted children show a significant genetic component to IQ and a number of personality characteristics.  - If you could choose between having a child (via egg/sperm donor) with Donor A: an unemployed drug addict or Donor B: a Harvard law professor, which donor would you choose?  - The majority of pregnant women in America, when told that their child is likely be born with a severe birth defect, choose to abort their pregnancies.    All in all, \\"Eugenics: A Reassessment\\" is a well organized book touching on many different topics relating to eugenics.  Lynn's evidence should be carefully considered, as some of his arguments are much better supported than others.  Additionally, I would have expected this book to be more embracing of new ideas.  However, \\"Eugenics: A Reassessment\\" tracks the history of eugenics, looks at where eugenics stands today, and makes many predictions about its future.  It is an important read for anyone interested in the subject matter.	2005-10-10

As Brad chronicles the events of his life and the massive obstacles that he overcame due to Tourettes Syndorme, you cry, you laugh and you get angry.

Wow, this could've been so much better then what was given to me. Since my, A Nightmare on Elm Street 1 review might've been all around and hard to follow, let me break down this review.<br /><br />First off folks, the storyline. Young, punk-rock, get the hell out of my face Jess Golden has a premonition of the building she's playing in collapsing. Oh my God, what does she do? Why, my friends, she gets her ass out of there of course. But those who follow her, including the terribly annoying, preppy Eric (I'll get to this guy later) and her somewhat boyfriend Jamie, are thankfully saved from the inevitable death that awaits them (big words)! Then they all seem to die off rather slowly, and I wasn't that much interested.<br /><br />In the creativity department, I guess you can say Rhodes tried her best. Again, it felt kind of repetitive in some points in the book. I rarely felt scared or gloomy like I did in the dark Suffer the Children novel. It seemed too funny to be scary. I never once really, deeply cared about the characters. And by the end of the novel (and only at the end for some reason), the word `cos' was used more than the number of games the Chicago White Sox have won (and they've won a lot for all those who didn't already know). Ugh, what can I say, I only spent $8 on it...<br /><br />In the fear and gore department....cricket noises please. I was rarely scared, and the gore was kept to a minimum. There's not much I can say without spoiling the plot.<br /><br />And finally, in the Eric department. My god, he is an annoying son of a bitch. If he were a true person, I would have killed him myself, not saying that he dies or anything...or does he? I can't spoil this book for you, even if I did somewhat dislike it.<br /><br />Overall, it's an okay read with okay characters and okay ideas. Still, Dead Reckoning could've been so much better. Oh well, maybe Destination Zero (which seems to have helicopters in it, based on the preview in the end of the book) will be more exciting and better.<br /><br />I give it 2 annoying Erics out of 5<br /><br />Rated PG-13: language and violencew in the end of the book) will be more exciting and better. <br /> <br />I give it 2 annoying Erics out of 5 <br /> <br />Rated PG-13: language and violence <br />	2005-10-13

The story is the second book in a series. It begins right where it left off from the first book, Across the Nightingale Floor. It alternates from the voice of Takeo to the omnipresent narrator who shadows Takeo's lover, Kaede Shirakawa. Romance, endurance, and violence make this tale a must read because the author makes the reader feel as if he is part of whole experience. <br /> <br />This book has some challenging reading. Hearn's style is loaded with imagery and empathy. Every page I read I feel like I know and understand all the pains Takeo and Kaede go through, and their longing for each other. Hearn is an unbelievably talented writer. She draws out my emotions. She makes me feel sorry for both of them. At times, I wanted to dive into the pages and help them succeed with their missions. In Every chapter, Hearn switches from Takeo's point of view to the narration of Kaede's endeavors. I feel their pain, their thoughts of longing. As I read each chapter, their longing becomes greater and more passionate. Takeo's trials are the most absorbing for me as a male reader. His experiences with pain, combat, and love interested me the most. I felt like I personally knew his lifestyle and his every reaction. I practically cheered him on like a fan in the stands, hoping that he somehow gets back to Kaede. They are two people in love who are separated, and she makes me see how love is an impenetrable magnet that cannot be broken. The author's style brings out a level of empathy for two main characters that I have never experienced before in a novel. <br />	2005-10-12

The book relates the story of a young boy, Shadow, who has to deal with the trauma of losing a beloved older brother.  It reminds me very much of the famous S E Hinton book, Rumble Fish, and to a lesser degree, THE OUTSIDERS, for all three books are about what happens when your adored older brother turns out to have feet of clay?  in SHADOW OF A DOUBT (cute name), Shadow Thompson was just a tad when bro Daniel ran away from home, leaving his mom and dad desolate and depending on him for amusement, but being too grief-stricken really to attend to his needs, so he retreated into the wonderland of Goth, or maybe not retreated, perhaps \\"discovered his subject position\\" would be a better way to put it.  He wears dark glasses, even indoors, so nobody can see his eyes and guess what his feelings are.<br /><br />Daniel comes back at the beginning of the book-wanted for murder!  I thought this was a little bit of overkill.  Couldn't he have just come back period?  Nothing else in the book would have changed.  I notice that with the novels of Rottman.  She always tosses in more than the book can really handle, or more than they need.  There was the one book I remember about the girl who was in high school with her boyfriend who's more of a horndog than she can handle, and between that and her swimming career the book would have been quite full already, and then she had to have yet another plot about uncaring parents who saddle the poor girl with an older brother who has Downs syndrome (and still wants to swim).  Too much!<br /><br />But in SHADOW OF A DOUBT, young Shadow has to now cope with the law and wanting to protect his brother, rather like the Hinton novels.  My own nephew adores the book and even said that he would consider joining the debating team, after reading this book.  Well, he calls it the \\"forensics team\\" and it turns out he thought \\"forensics\\" is what it is on his favorite TV shows BONES and CSI, for his dearest wish is to grow up and have a job relating to dead bodies and murder, I think he'll be in for a surprise when he joins the debate team and there's no rotting flesh involved.<br /><br />I would give Rottman's novel an A Plus for trying, but in the end it's not very involving.  However I am over fifteen and perhaps young readers (its target audience) would ignore its lack of plausibility and instead groove on Shadow's fashion sense and growing love interest.

She is hoping to help other women avoid moments like when she was jilted by Lord Pomeroy, which by the way was not her fault.  Meredith gets this harebrained idea to spy on London's most noted rake, Lord Alexander Lansing, in none other than, a hot air balloon.  When the balloon gets too close to the treetops and ruptures, Meredith lands right on top of poor Alexander's chest. This crash-landing, will forever change the course of Meredith and Alexander's lives.<br /><br />A Lady's Guide to Rakes is by author Kathryn Caskie.  This is fairy tale regency that speaks to the heart of gentility, opulence and of course, rakes.

It's worse than his previous worst novel, Ancient Evenings, which single-handedly turned me off for years on all things Egyptian.<br /><br />No, I'm not some outraged evangelical railing at someone making use of \\"My Lord `n Savior,\\" I think Jesus is fair game and a fine topic for literature and speculation. But I'm not going to do as so many others seem willing to and automatically bestow praise on a book merely because it takes the sacred Jesus and casts him into the harsh light of modern judgment. In The Gospel According To The Son, Norman Mailer, proponent of the \\"non-fiction novel\\" (figure that one out) manages to make a good story dull and argumentative, drains all color and life from the plot, and delivers something that is SO dead on arrival it's unrecognizable as the tale of Jesus: a biography already filled with drama, betrayal, false arrest, torture, execution, and all the raw material of a gripping story. I've got to hand it to Mailer, not everyone could take a story ready-made for adaptation, all-but handed to him on a silver platter like the head of Saint John the Baptist, and then smash it down to third-rate nonsense. Here even the Devil was boring and it takes A LOT to ruin the best villain ever created. Mailer seemed to want to absent all vestiges of Christ from this little re-telling of the life of the historical man, Jesus of Nazareth, and I can actually respect that, but in rendering this material so skeptically humanistic as to be bland beyond tolerance puzzles me. I can't say I laughed out loud at the truly bad jokes slipped in here and there amid the equally execrable prose, but the line about \\"Peter was like a rock...he could be broken by a bigger rock...\\" elicited a genuine chuckle that something so lame made it past an editor.<br /><br />Right after he released this work back in the late `90's, I heard the author on NPR saying, in essence, \\"The Gospels are badly composed. There are many writers who could have written them better, and I am foremost among that number.\\" Mailer's ego knows no bounds and his trash talking was a little endearing. I just wish he was able to back it all up with a better book than this.<br /><br />The bottom line is this book blows. Skip it in favor of The Last Temptation of Christ, or read a good translation of the four Gospels.d.

At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrated artistic promotional film marketing campaign worldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the printing press for this unprecedented franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.  Does this mean that Mr. Sansweet has not aquired all of them in his envious collection of Star Wars memorabilia?  Not likely.  Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.  This can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variations out there to keep collectors like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scouring the farthest reaches of the globe and the galaxy for years to come.	2005-10-14

I read Martha Beck's book and was astounded to see how accurate her description of Mormonism was. Don't pay attention to all those one star reviews. They are probably all written by angry Mormons. I think that there is one thing that they have yet to realize; it is the fact that most of those books that tell the truth about Mormonism and its lunatic, lazy founder Joseph Smith, were written by people who were related to extremely eminent personalities in the Mormon community. Martha Beck is the daughter of Hugh Nibley, Sandra Tanner is related to Brigham Young, Fawn Brodie was the grand-daughter of one of their prophets (I don't remember which one - that will probably give Mormons the opportunity to make fun of me since they apparently tend to focus on small details!), Steve Benson is the grandson of Ezra Taft Benson, etc. The list is very long, but I have not read everything. All I know is that I trust those people and the fact that they were brought up at the core of Mormonism makes me think that they know a lot more than the \\"average\\" member. Furthermore, I trust the government of the United States and all the national archives regarding Joseph Smith. I love this country and its laws. Mormons believe that the Constitution was divinely inspired: God inspired the Founding Fathers in their writing it. They also believe that polygamy, as taught by Mr. Smith was divinely inspired. Why would God contradict himself so much? He would inspire monogamy to the Founding Fathers, and then, less than 50 years later, he would inspire polygamy to Joseph Smith? How contradictory is that? Their Book of Mormon contradicts itself so clearly that I find amazing that they cannot make that out. For instance, contrary to the rest of Christianity they don't believe that Jesus IS God. However when you read Mosiah 7:27 it is clearly taught that Jesus IS God. I could go on and on, but that would not change anything. I am not a psychiatrist and I am not really familiar with brainwashing. THANK YOU, MARTHA!	2005-10-11

The concept was to take the Culinary Classic of All Culinary Classics --- MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING, Julia Child's opus that taught American women everywhere that they, too, could create great French cuisine --- and attempt to make all 524 recipes within one year. And, while doing so, she'd chronicle her adventures in a blog. <br /> <br />Starting out with simple recipes like potato soup, the assignments get increasingly more difficult. Throughout the year she is entertained and assisted by an entire cast of extras, including her understanding husband, her brother, her crazy friends, and the growing number of readers who are tuning into her blog with regularity. As Julie delves into increasingly complex recipes, such as Bifteck Sautau Bercy (her search for bone marrow for that particular recipe is truly hilarious), she learns as much about herself as she does about cooking. <br /> <br />Powell is a talented writer, and her blog remains one of the better examples of that medium to this day. Her writing style --- confessional, self-deprecating, occasionally rambling --- is really well-suited to the blog space, which makes the book version of her story occasionally feel like it's veering off-center. When she's hard at work in the kitchen, her writing is sharp and self-assured --- but Powell strays off-track a few too many times into less central aspects of her life (and especially her friends' lives) that, frankly, aren't that interesting. One wishes she would keep her focus on the food --- but when she does concentrate on that, Powell is so good you're ready to forgive her the errant lapses (at least until they happen again.) <br /> <br />At the end of the story, you have a woman who puts a lot of effort into both her cooking and her book. If the end result (in both cases) is a bit uneven,at the very least you're left with a strong and engaging woman who, through much trial and effort, discovers unknown levels of determination and ability within herself. <br /> <br />Which, if you think about it, is what Julia Child would have wanted all along. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lourdes Orive	2005-10-13

While commiserating with her editor, Jess jokingly mentions that she and Erin should change lives.

I am pasting this review that i had originally posted in 2001 at other websites.<br /><br />This is one of the best books i have read. I have several years of experience in C/C++ and some experience in windows programming however I am a 'absolute beginner' with Windows device drivers and kernel mode programming and i was able to grasp almost everything the book spoke about with relative ease and with NO confusions. I would recommend this book to anyone who has absolutely no background in device driver programming but wants to make a career doing just that. I must admit that the books assumes that you are versed with C/C++ and some understanding of programming paradigm for windows, but it is pretty obvious since this is NOT a book to teach a programming language nor it is aimed at teaching regular windows programming. It is a complete 'NO NONSENSE' book that deals with topics right upto the point. The contents of the book flow gracefully explaining each and every step with precise detail. The author seems to have made the best possible effort to explain the basics before jumping directly into details. And that does help an absolute beginner. This book does NOT cover details about device specific drivers but it does help you reach a point where you are confident that 'you will understand' whatever you research on your own. A very good book... have seen very few of these types lately.	2005-10-10

There are only a few cap makers among the younger generation of weavers and most senior basketmakers are no longer weaving caps. Many weavers never become sufficiently accomplished to weave caps. The theme of this exhibition, the woven cap, is the result of the need to examine the most challenging of twined baskets and to accentuate their significance. Woven basket caps are the pinnacle of closed-work twined basketmaking. The love of caps and the exchange of ideas between art historian Ron Johnson, basketmaker Susan \\"Tweet\\" Burdick, and basket expert Coleen Kelley Marks inspired this exhibition. Tweet commented to the author last summer at a Karuk Flower Dance that there are so few weavers of basket caps that in the future there may not be enough for the ceremonial dances. Coleen Kelley Marks and Ron Johnson chose the theme of woven caps and limited the exhibition to known weavers. Each weaver's accomplishments are emphasized through introductions and interviews in which their caps and the processes of weaving and gathering are discussed.	2005-10-09

This was something with a decidedly different look.  Oh sure, there's a beautiful, nude woman on the cover, but upon opening up the book I was surprised at what I found there.  Walter Girotto was a totally unknown artist to me until I got this book.  Girotto is an Italian artist who came to the United States back in 1985.  I hesitate to categorize him as a pin-up or erotic artists, although his work certainly has those qualities.  But Girotto is something more.  Working in oils, pastels, even crayon and colored pencil, his work produced on wood gives it an aged, textured, grainy look.  He blends a Renaissance period look with 21st century eroticism to create a completely unique style.  Going beyond traditional pin-up art, Girotto's work really classifies as fine art.<br /><br />His different methods and tools produce some startling work, and it's really unlike anything I've ever seen.  Take the piece simply called \\"Nude 30\\" showing a radiant blonde that was finished with colored pencil on prepared paper.  I don't think that paper was prepared for Girotto!  \\"Shauna Wearing Red Boots\\" features the beautiful subject lying nude on a divan clad in only red boots.  These pieces complement his smooth, soft style perfectly.<br /><br />I love a painting called \\"Unconcerned\\" in which Girotto combines oils and pastels on this seductive woman with full, pouty lips and eyes closed.  \\"Love Temptation\\" seems derived right out of the 1500's with the nude blonde subject holding a bunch of pink roses while a cherub hovers over her shoulder.  Julie Strain has never looked quite so refined as she does in \\"Julie Strain Portrait\\" showing the scream queen amidst of Renaissance Era sculptures with a cherub lying at her feet.<br /><br />Throughout the 100 plus page collection you'll find yourself mesmerized at this incredibly talented artists who has taken eroticism to a whole other level.

I don't know. But the book is excellent not just for females but for guys as well. It goes through those thoughts that most ladies have about a man and it shows what you should expect. I like that throughout the book, Greg is sure to let ladies know that they deserve someone who wants them and wants to treat them right! This is a great book for yourself or to give to a girlfriend!	2005-10-10

Longing for clothing, leisure and privilege, she soon takes up with Drouet, a man willing to support her if she'll consent to live together, unmarried.  From there, she develops an attraction for a married man, Hurstwood, and the power and privilege he possesses.  Their relations and the result of their decisions constitute much of the book. <br /> <br />This novel presented scandalous scenarios of a young, impressionable, and not especially moral woman in a rather dispassionate tone.  It was a rebellious scenario for the times and worth reading for the glimpse it provides into American big city life in the early 20th century. <br /> <br />The writing, however, is unsophisticated, especially in the first half and the characters are superficial.  Readers aren't allowed a deeper look into their minds and motivations.  Except at one point, when Hurstwood engages in serious deception, the book lacks the tension and strong plot that drive American Tragedy.   <br /> <br />For those who haven't read Dreiser before, American Tragedy is a better place to start.  But for those who want to read more of his work, Sister Carrie offers a interesting look into morality, family, and urban life.     <br />	2005-10-08

Sadly this early introduction to the supposedly \\"modern\\" notion of \\"open theism\\" is merely Socinianism redressed in new clothes, the most prominent spokesmen being Carl Bangs, Clark Pinnock and Greg Boyd.  Why ostensibly educated people are so taken by their vacuous \\"arguments\\" is a mystery; it's just a repeat of \\"Did God say?\\" back in Genesis 3.  Satan need not think up any new lies when man keeps falling for the same old one and the frightening thing is that one must wonder if or how as with Adam, these people are also not deceived, but are eating this forbidden fruit knowingly.  1 Timothy 2:14.  God knows - whether they shake their impotent fists against Him or not.  When one compares the awesome prodigous inspiration and brilliance of saints like Augustine who have illumined Christ's Church for so many centuries with the puny little incredibly arrogant figures of those who decide to reject him like Pinnock, one doesn't know whether to laugh or to cry.  How like modernity's view of \\"truth\\" as having nothing to do with veracity, of whether anything is even a proposition, much less whether it's true or false, but rather exclusively utilitarian, something to be used for power aggrandizement.  But as with Naziism and Communism, these devils break their pawns and will horribly destroy them either here or in the hereafter.  Matthew 10:28.  See this illustrated in \\"That Hideous Strength\\" by C.S. Lewis and the horrible end of the sagacious Frost and Wither, both appropriately named, especially the latter.  God is in full control as a profoundly happy God whose joy is our strength.  May people turn to that joyful truth and away from this sad book of delusion.  Nehemiah 8:10.	2005-10-13

I thought this book was an excellent way to learn about the history to the game through the eyes of each collector.  In addition the photos were just amazing and were able to illuminate the already very colorful writing of Steven Wong. I can see just why each collector is so passionate about their pieces.  I am truly surprised by the number of rare memorabilia and artifacts that the author managed to bring together so neatly in this book.  Many pieces should be worthy of any historical musuem or even the hall of fame.  The book itself should be placed as a permanent piece in the Smithsonian musuem!!  Bravo.

First, they start talking about the kinematics that result in trauma, and focus on teaching the reader on how interpreting and figuring out the event preceeding the trauma can give a better understanding of the injuries (external and potentially internal) the patient is suffering, and how to care for them, on the pre-hospital environment, without delaying transport to an appropriate medical facility because of executing unnecesary interventions. <br /> <br />The book not only deals with advanced life support procedures, but it deals greatly with basic procedures, so in the end, PHTLS is suitable for ANYONE that works with trauma patients on the pre-hospital environment. <br /> <br />When you buy the PHTLS book, be aware that you are going to read a book made with a totally differente approach. Think later of the methodology of care the PHTLS tries to propagate and you'll find out that, today, it is the best approach available for dealing with trauma patients. <br /> <br />You won't regret this purchase!	2005-10-10

Johnson, author of one of my personal favorites _Mind Wide Open_, argues that video games and TV are actually growing more complex and demanding far more cognitively from players and watchers. With video games, he leaks the little secret that no one who has never played today's video games--especially their critics--do not know: video games are fiendishly difficult. In playing a few with my five-year-old, I realize that I use problem solving and decision making skills that even the most demanding novels don't require. As for TV, he argues that shows like _The West Wing_, _Arrested Development_, and _The Simpsons_ rival literary novels in their complexity and the cognitive work they demand. Ultimately though he says the true measure of popular culture's edifying effects is not looking at high brow programming but comparing yesterday's \\"crap\\" to today's. He proceeds to do so by comparing \\"The Apprentice\\" to the \\"Love Boat\\" and finds evidence to support his claims. I enjoyed this book a great deal but felt his examples are very carefully chosen: he carefully avoids writing about today's real \\"crap\\", such as \\"Fear Factor\\" and the like, and he focuses on cognitively-demanding virtual quest video games and GOD games while avoiding more simplistic fare, such as racing and sports games that require little thought or strategy.	2005-10-10

For example, the human mind is excellent at recognizing patterns in things...to such a degree that we find many patterns in things which are actually random.  Another bias is the basic tendency to be accepting of evidence which is consistent with our belief but subjecting contradictory evidence to more careful scrutiny.  I have heard the explanation that chronic gamblers tend to relive their wins and block out their losses.  In actual fact, they dwell on the losses a lot more than the wins.  If so, why do they continue not only to gamble, but believe that they are better at it than they really are?  The answer is that their wins are almost always viewed as due to talent and many of the losses are re-categorized as \\"near wins.\\" (\\"If not for that field goal in the last seconds of the game, I would have won\\"--much more so than the corresponding \\"I almost lost that one, but they kicked a field goal at the end of the game and saved it for me.\\")  The first 125 pages cover six different types of bias (and variations of them). <br /> <br />The last third of the book analyzes three cases (alternative medicine, social interaction strategies, & ESP) where there is a lot of belief which is not supported by evidence.  These help a lot in making the ideas from the first part more concrete.	2005-10-14

It's all well and good to have a property grow up, but this is just sick gritty for the sake of being gritty.  Some of our beloved characters get killed.  Cheetara is raped daily.  Wily Kit, a child, grows up as Mummra's sex slave.  It's just disgusting.  It's like an extremely bad fanfic, written by an overzealous and sexually frustrated teen.  To add to this is how badly the sexual abuse is handled.  Despite being ravaged for years, chained up in a mine, etc, Cheetara is drawn like a Playboy model.  And not only does her body not suffer the torture, but she doesn't seem broken or mentally unstable like true rape victims are.  Obviously, the idea of Cheetara being raped is MEANT to be sensual and to sell the book, otherwise we wouldn't be treated to full page spreads of her looking sexy in chains.  (And people attack \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" for glorifying rape... that was realistic in the horror). <br /> <br />On the same token, Wily Kit, who is obviously at this point the product of child rape and molestation (by a frickin' MUMMY) seems trong willed and again, is drawn in a way that must be to make comic book fanboys go \\"HEHEH!!  Look, sexy!\\" <br /> <br />And to finish it up, later in this series, the Thundercats have to team with the Mutants against the Dogs of War.  And what happens?  Apperantly, the Thundercats forgive all that horror upon them, have a big celebration feast and Lion-o TOASTS Mumm-ra!?  \\"Cheers to Mumm-ra, who killed my people and raped my friends!\\"  I'm surprised they didn't have Cheetara giggle at the mutants sitting at the table and say \\"So... my room later?\\" <br /> <br />All in all, a TERRIBLE, repulsive story and anyone who showers it with praise is obviously degenerate and has no true love for the original. <br />	2005-10-10

Readers familiar with work by Bloom, Nussbaum and Slaughter and Leslie (to mention a few) will be familiar with the wailings of liberal arts protectionists.  Gieger is refreshing unemotive about such issues.  His concerns are teasing out the expression and impact of competition and consumerism in the universities over students and research.<br /><br />It is a book replete with interesting and arresting stats and arguments, and I won't pretend to do justice to it here.  However, his analysis of the connection between student retention rates, inter university competition and student consumerism will resonate with most academics' experiences of their teaching environment.  Interestingly, Gieger also mulls over the growing disconnection of research institutes from the educational core mission of universities.  The periphery and centre are no longer in communion -  a point becoming more obvious by the day.  As he points out, criticism that classroom instruction is 'falling behind' is grounded largely in the mistaken supposition that periphery and core are in communion. The weakest part of the book, in my opinion the main blemish, is the last chapter dealing with universities and the markets. It is a bit vague and rambling with the the odd dollop of personal judgement thrown into the mix.  For instance, Gieger asserts that the research market is 'beautifully efficient' (p 249).  Not everyone would agree with this statement nor that efficiency equals either value for money nor utility.  He does conclude this chapter by upbraiding the universities for not investing heavily enough in teaching, and not emphasising that a degree of insulation from commercial activity is desirable.  Nevertheless, the chapter is composed of a lot of sections beginning, Firtsly, Secondly, Thirdly, ... lending a list structure to the text suggesting a hurried approach that jars with the rest of the work.<br /><br />Overall, I found this book informative and in the main lively.  It is not prose on a par with some of the more polemical writers in the field but well worth reading nevertheless.ist structure to the text suggesting a hurried approach that jars with the rest of the work. <br /> <br />Overall, I found this book informative and in the main lively.

I have been a fan of Mr. Stirling's writing since a friend gave me a copy of 'Island in the Sea of Time'.  He continues to make me a happy reader with his new series begun in 'Dies the Fire' and continued here in 'The Protector's War'.<br /><br />  In contrast to some of the other reviewers' I really really like his inclusion of the Wiccan society and ritual in the storyline.  I am not a Wiccan myself, as a matter of fact I'm agnostic if anything, but I found his presentation of paganism to be very open-minded and interesting.  The fact that one almost never hears of this religion outside of a book written by one of it's adherants makes it a nice change from the usual Judeo-Christian centered stories.  Contrast is a good thing in my opinion.<br /><br />  Otherwise he continues to please with his speculation of where things would go and what people would do.  I would perhaps disagree with some of his conclusions but that's kinda what speculation is all about.  It makes your imagination run around inside your head and that's why I love these kinds of books written by Steve Stirling, Harry Turtledove and Eric Flint.	2005-10-12

US	12085510	R14R65UINRS1QU	0590409433	33953133	Fallen Angels	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Great Read	Fallen Angels is a historical fiction book about the Vietnam War.  The book begins when the main character Perry is waiting to get on a plane to take him over to the foreign country.  He meets a young nurse that he talks to for a little while and then she leaves rather quickly.  Perry is from Harlem, and his mother and his younger brother Kenny live there.  He often writes to them throughout the book.  When Perry goes over to Vietnam he meets a guy named peewee who becomes his best friend.  They are put into the same platoon and same location where they meet several other guys that they fight alongside for the remainder of the book.  The story frequently jumps from calm almost normal living, to intense firefights and gruesome violence.  This book is probably suitable for ages 16 and up for strong language, racial gestures, along with intense violence.  <br /> This book is four stars for several reasons, Myers creates a very realistic main character; he is not a Rambo or a super genius.  Perry is just a regular black male from the streets of Harlem who lives middle class life and is only in the war for the money he gets paid.  This gives an \\"at home\\" feeling.  Perry is definitely not some manly super solider who can kill Vietcong at will.  This is a guy who is deathly afraid every time he has to go out on to patrol,  a man who cannot see the Vietcong he is shooting at sometimes, and can only hear the whiz of bullets in the pitch darkness.  Perry is a character that can be related to in everyday life; he is a son and a brother, who just wants to come out of this conflict alive.  Coming out alive seems to be a recurring theme throughout this novel.  Instead of trying to show a bunch of heroic soldiers killing Vietnamese people. Myers stresses the fact that these are all ordinary men.  Men, who are counting down the days when their lives are no longer at risk, and they get the opportunity to go home.  For example, one of Perry's commanding officers has only a small amount of days left \\"in country\\".  As the novel progresses and the day comes closer to when he can leave, his soldiers start to protect him and make it a point to keep him safe.  This shows how much each soldier respects the desire to go back home and will try to make it happen for themselves as well as their comrades.  Finally my last reason why this book is a heart will mostly appeal to male readers.  This book is about Vietnam so of course it is action packed and filled with gruesome incidents.  Some of the things are very sad and almost unbelievable, but the firefights are fun to read and the book keeps you on the edge of your seat.  But it is not all action, humor thrown in there every now and then, shows the reader that the soldiers are still human.  All in all this book is one that should not be passed over because of its historical relevance and brilliant writing by Walter Dean Myers.     <br />	2005-10-13

This book hits on so many levels, it's difficult to know where to start.  Abel Jones as the frugal Welsh Methodist kills me with his wry one-liners on society, then throws in a profound insight on the nature of Christianity.  He goes from comedian to theologian in the space of a paragraph.   <br />The characters are very convincingly presented - I highly recommend the audio version, in which the narrator does a masterful job with pacing and accents.  For the last week, I've rushed out of work, eager to start my drive home so I can hear what kind of trouble Abel Jones is going to get himself into and out of next.  <br />If there are weaknesses in the book, they're in the casualness of the violence and in the twisted nature of the political and intelligence games being played.  So many people die in so many bizarre ways that's it's difficult to keep track of who is killing whom; also, the complex intrigues that populate the book tiptoe right to the edge of incredulity.  Still, Abel Jones' making sense of it all in his sober Welsh way is a great literary device.  Another thing I really like about the book is that it is self-contained.  I haven't read any of the three \\"Abel Jones\\" books that precede this one, but I don't feel lost in this one because I haven't read the others.  There are allusions to characters that I assume come from the preceding books, but my unacquaintance with these characters didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book.  <br />I had no idea before I got into this book and started trying to find out about the author on the Internet that Owen Parry is a pseudonym for Ralph Peters, but it's interesting to me that someone I consider one of the best thinkers on modern strategy is also such a capable novelist.  I can't wait to tackle the other books in the series.	2005-10-09

Because of Leo Carey's wry, admiring, melancholy essay in THE NEW YORKER, I grabbed these novels when I found them at a local used bookstore, and oh, how I wanted to like them more than I ended up doing.  But they're just not as good as the hype.  They drift all over the place [to be fair, Carey admitted that devotees of mysteries would find these books too undisciplined], and the narrator's aggressively amoral personality -- imagine P. G. Wodehouse's Bertie Wooster crossed with Jonathan Gash's Lovejoy -- can wear on one after a while.  The plots are made of Swiss cheese, at best, and these books are also sadly dated in their views of women.  Maybe it's because I read the Lovejoy books before these -- if I had come to them without knowing about Lovejoy, I would have enjoyed them more.	2005-10-11

I believe that in anything there is a positive. As we all walk our own path in life we encounter people who cross our paths. It is up to us to learn from them. We are all trying to reach the same top of the mountain (whatever our beliefs might be). There is no need to be negative about anything...whether it be religion, politics, anything. We all need positivity. All of the people born into this world has a purpose. We are all born with needs: Validation, Worth, Happiness, and Peace. That is what we should strive for. The world itself is already full of turmoil. We all have a responsibility to bring in more positivity. If we can learn even 1% from something on how to be more positive, then we are on the right frame of mind. We need not tell the other person their path is wrong or right. Because our path is not necessarily their path (vice-versa). I hope that my review is taken in with open-mindedness. May your life be at peace and get better everyday, in everyway.	2005-10-10

Upon reading it, I only felt filled with much more anxiety about the whole process in part because of its ommissions.  While there are whole chapters on the emotional aspects of the deployment, most of the information is general and useless.  Some of it appears to just have been cut and pasted from other books that have no relation to deployment or military life.   Giving only one spouse's perspective is another weakness.  The author only experienced Marine deployments and treated 1 year overseas deployments as outside the norm.  For Army families, they are common and there is very little information about what to do when a spouse is gone for more than six months.  It, like most deployment counseling, offers no help to the families who are not integrated in to a unit - and therefore have no FRG which \\"Surviving Deployment\\" laziliy suggests turning to for all questions left unanswered.	2005-10-12

After playing the D20 adventure, \\"Death in Freeport,\\" my interest was piqued in the Unspeakable One and the Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign.  As it turns out, both were inspired by Hastur and the Yellow Sign.  So I decided to go to the source and read the original stories that helped craft the mythology of the Great Old One known as Hastur and his crazy book, \\"The King in Yellow.\\"<br /><br />Briefly, Hastur is both a place and a being.  He/it is loosely connected to the cities of Carcosa, Yhtill, and Alar.  Hastur and Alar are divided in a battle of succession.  Yhtill is a city of the past, while Carcosa is a haunted city of the future. All of the cities are near Lake Hali. The cities are on a planet near the star Aldebaran in the Hyades, a planet with two moons and two suns.  The inhabitants may be black or white (sources disagree).<br /><br />What they all agree on is that the Phantom of Truth appears during the siege between the two cities.  The Phantom wears a mask and tells everyone else to wear a mask to avoid the appearance of the King in Yellow, who will ultimately usurp all royal successors thereafter.<br /><br />So everyone wears a mask, including the jaded and bitter Queen Camilla, her clueless daughter Cassilda, and her two sons Thale and Uoht.  The plan is that by wearing masks, everyone will be saved from the King in Yellow's inevitable appearance.  But the King in Yellow easily thwarts the Phantom of Truth, and he thereafter declares that everyone must wear a mask as well as the yellow sign, a squiggly three-armed symbol.<br /><br />Sometimes Hastur is described as the King in Yellow, sometimes he's described as the Phantom of Truth, and sometimes he looks an awful lot like Cthulhu.<br /><br />Oh yeah, someone transcribed all of this down into a play.  If you read it or watch it, you go mad.  Or you slowly get drawn into the play.  Or the characters from the play come after you.  It's complicated.<br /><br />The Second Edition of the Hastur Cycle contains 14 different stories, all of them collected by Robert M. Price into one volume.  They are loosely connected by the mythology of Hastur.  I'll try to elaborate on each story and make sense of it all...without going mad.<br /><br />\\"Haita the Shepherd\\" and \\"An Inhabitant of Carcosa\\" are both by Ambrose Bierce, he of the \\"Devil's Dictionary.\\"  In \\"Haita the Shepherd\\", a shepherd struggles in a relentless pursuit of a beautiful woman, who turns out to be an ideal.  It's a bittersweet commentary on life.  In \\"Inhabitant,\\" we discover that Bierce invented the Sixth Sense plot twist before M. Night Shyamalan. They're both short and neither are particularly riveting to a modern audience.<br /><br />HASTUR:  In \\"Haita,\\" Hastur is a benevolent deity of shepherds that Haita prays to.  Occasionally, Hastur does nice things for Haita.  But he doesn't have much of a role.  In \\"Inhabitant,\\" we have...well, an inhabitant of the city of Carcosa.  He refers to Hali as a person, not a lake.<br /><br />Robert W. Chambers wrote the next two stories, \\"The Repairer of Reputations\\" and \\"The Yellow Sign.\\"  In \\"Repairer,\\" the play known as The King in Yellow appears for the first time.  It establishes the subsequent madness that ensues by any who read The King in Yellow, as evidenced by the narrator of \\"The Repairer of Reputations.\\"  What's not immediately clear is that this story takes place in the future, where suicide chambers are government sanctioned.  The future twist muddles the story a bit, as the setting isn't relevant to the plot.  But it keeps you guessing.  \\"Yellow,\\" on the other hand, is just an out-and-out creep fest, with a zombie who keeps muttering, \\"Have you found the Yellow Sign?\\" Good stuff, dramatic endings, and in both cases the characters aren't yammering about the horrors they witnessed from the safety of the afterword, a trait all too often found in Lovecraft and his imitators.<br /><br />HASTUR: These two stories lay the foundation that reading the King in Yellow drives you bonkers.  They both hint at what happens in the first act of the play, which involves the Phantom of Truth.  And this, unfortunately, is where we learn about the hearse-driver zombie.  He will be rammed into just about every story afterwards, even where he doesn't belong.  But that's not Chambers' fault.<br /><br />\\"The River of Night's Dreaming,\\" by Karl Edward Wagner, is a decidedly modern take on the King in Yellow mythos.  It's scarier than the others, but a little less creative in forcing the main character (a young woman who has escaped prison) into the story itself, in a sort of Gothica/Misery movie scenario.  One character refers to \\"The King in Yellow\\" as \\"vintage porno,\\" and that's an adequate description of this story.  I felt a little dirty after reading it.<br /><br />HASTUR:  Unlike the other stories in this volume, \\"River\\" makes no attempt to expand or include the King in Yellow.  Instead, it focuses on repressed Victorian desires. Which is a bit of an assumption in the first place that anything in the King in Yellow has to do with the Victorian-era.<br /><br />That brings us to \\"More Light\\" by James Blish, the crown jewel of the collection.  As a story, it's not very entertaining.  It's basically a guy reading \\"The King in Yellow\\" on a dare.  It also establishes a trope that gets old fast: the narrator refers to Lovecraft's writings as if they were real.  Oh, the irony!<br /><br />HASTUR: This is the mother of all Hastur resources.  It gives us almost the entire play of The King in Yellow.  The story itself is bland, but the narrative of the play is fantastic and incorporates all the elements from the other stories.  One thing that does get a bit silly is the insistence by authors of including EVERY bit of trivia about the Hastur mythos.  The undead hearse driver from \\"The Yellow Sign\\" isn't just in the story, he's the Phantom of Truth.  In \\"The Yellow Sign\\" someone remarks that the hearse driver's finger broke off (a consequence of being a zombie) and sure enough, it's mentioned in the play.  If anything, the play is almost too thorough.  But we'll take it, as Blish manages to put the various quotes together into a cohesive whole that is rather freaky.<br /><br />The Hastur Cycle begins to stray with \\"The Novel of the Black Seal\\" by Arthur Machen.  It's nearly unreadable, because of the stilted Victorian prose.  Suffice it to say that the story involves the \\"little people\\" and their worship of the Yellow Sign, but takes such a long time to get there that you no longer care about the ending.<br /><br />HASTUR: None.  Price posits that this story served as the inspiration for \\"The Whisperer in the Darkness\\" by H.P. Lovecraft. Which is a bit of a tangent, as \\"Whisperer\\" has almost nothing to do with Hastur.<br /><br />\\"Whisperer in the Darkness\\" is one of those stories that would actually be more entertaining if it were updated.  Most of it takes place between two characters exchanging letters, with one of the authors continually updating his pen pal.  It would play much better as an email exchange.  It's even a little creepy, given that it deals with intelligent lobster fungi called Mi-Go.<br /><br />HASTUR: Lovecraft's sole contribution mentions the Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign and Hastur in passing. Supposedly, \\"there is a whole secret cult of evil men...devoted to the purpose of tracking [the Mi-Go] down and injuring them on behalf of monstrous powers from other dimensions.\\" Presumably those monstrous powers are Hastur.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Price now takes the connection of Mi-Go and goes crazy with it, spiraling off into a series of short stories that are focused on them instead of Hastur.  So we have \\"Documents in the Case of Elizabeth Akeley,\\" by Richard A. Lupoff, which is essentially a sequel to \\"Whisperer.\\"  It's followed by two short stories about humans visiting the home planet of the Mi-Go, called Yuggoth (or, as we call it, \\"Pluto\\").

Bless Derleth's heart, he does try hard.<br /><br />\\"The Feaster from Afar\\" turns Hastur into a flying boogeyman.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it contains the noteworthy death of a character.

Hastur is the Thing in the Lake (he apparently sleeps in it), and the citizens practice human sacrifice to him.  The verse is noteworthy for Price's intrusion as editor...he actually ADDS verse to the parts that are missing from Carter, who in turn took it from Blish.  I thought editors were supposed to edit, not write...and certainly not provide completely new verse into someone else's work.  But I digress.<br /><br />Ultimately, The Hastur Cycle is an important but flawed survey of Hastur mythology.  It's much less about Hastur than it is about Price's personal tastes on what stories influenced Lovecraft...as if the entire mythology's importance hinges upon Lovecraft's slim contribution.  What's missing are other stories by Chambers, such as \\"The Mask\\" and the \\"The Court of the Dragon.\\" Also missing are John Tynes' contributions, which have become part of the Hastur mythology mostly through Chaosium's support.<br /><br />Did I mention it contains the majority of \\"The King in Yellow?\\"  Read it, if you dare...s finger broke off (a consequence of being a zombie) and sure enough, it's mentioned in the play.  If anything, the play is almost too thorough.  But we'll take it, as Blish manages to put the various quotes together into a cohesive whole that is rather freaky. <br /> <br />The Hastur Cycle begins to stray with \\"The Novel of the Black Seal\\" by Arthur Machen.  It's nearly unreadable, because of the stilted Victorian prose.  Suffice it to say that the story involves the \\"little people\\" and their worship of the Yellow Sign, but takes such a long time to get there that you no longer care about the ending. <br /> <br />HASTUR: None.  Price posits that this story served as the inspiration for \\"The Whisperer in the Darkness\\" by H.P. Lovecraft. Which is a bit of a tangent, as \\"Whisperer\\" has almost nothing to do with Hastur. <br /> <br />\\"Whisperer in the Darkness\\" is one of those stories that would actually be more entertaining if it were updated.  Most of it takes place between two characters exchanging letters, with one of the authors continually updating his pen pal.  It would play much better as an email exchange.  It's even a little creepy, given that it deals with intelligent lobster fungi called Mi-Go. <br /> <br />HASTUR: Lovecraft's sole contribution mentions the Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign and Hastur in passing. Supposedly, \\"there is a whole secret cult of evil men...devoted to the purpose of tracking [the Mi-Go] down and injuring them on behalf of monstrous powers from other dimensions.\\" Presumably those monstrous powers are Hastur.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Price now takes the connection of Mi-Go and goes crazy with it, spiraling off into a series of short stories that are focused on them instead of Hastur.  So we have \\"Documents in the Case of Elizabeth Akeley,\\" by Richard A. Lupoff, which is essentially a sequel to \\"Whisperer.\\"  It's followed by two short stories about humans visiting the home planet of the Mi-Go, called Yuggoth (or, as we call it, \\"Pluto\\").  They're fast reads but are wasted space for anyone who wants to learn more about Hastur. <br /> <br />We finally get back to Hastur with \\"The Return of Hastur\\" by August Derleth.

A few loose ends were left open at the end of Aurora, is there going to be another book or are you just going to leave us HANGING!?  (...)  I guess that the publisher felt that there was not enough interest in this series, to continue to request more books be written.  So, I guess that this series is DEAD, no forthcoming books have been contracted.  Stupid publisher that has 'NO CLUE' what the readers want to read.  Skewed ratings resulted, I guess too many \\"Romance novel readers\\" diddn't like the Psychic Warrior series.

It carries a great deal of weight in today's ideologically charged environment. <br /> <br />Yu Yuan is fighting on Korean soil on behalf of a cause, Communism, that he does not believe in. He was conscripted into battle. He is not very enthusiastic about the counter-revolutionary force in China, Nationalism, either.  <br /> <br />Instead, Yu wants nothing except to return to a quiet family life back in China with his mother and fiance. After he is captured by the Americans and placed in a Korean prison camp as a Chinese POW, Yu finds it necessary to choose sides: communism or nationalism. Either choice carries immense risk. Fellow prisoners try, often violently, to extract loyalism from Yu, to ensure his allegiance. Prison life becomes very difficult for Yu, and it has nothing to do with his American guards. <br /> <br />This is the story about a man who is forced to make a difficult choice between two ideologies he does not believe in. The choice becomes a matter of life and death. <br /> <br />In the end, his choice is made on the basis of family, friendship and trust, not on the basis of either ideology. <br /> <br />The novel shows quite clearly how an ordinary man can be drawn into a world of powerful ideas and violent competition, a world that he does not want to participate in.  <br /> <br />In a broader context, the novel shows the immense power of abstract political thought in shaping the long-term destiny of nations and their citizens.	2005-10-10

It is largely this book that provides the foundation of this assessment. Whether one loves Kant or hates him (philosophically, that is), one cannot really ignore him; even when one isn't directly dealing with Kantian ideas, chances are great that Kant is made an impact.<br /><br />Kant was a professor of philosophy in the German city of Konigsberg, where he spent his entire life and career. Kant had a very organised and clockwork life - his habits were so regular that it was considered that the people of Konigsberg could set their clocks by his walks. The same regularity was part of his publication history, until 1770, when Kant had a ten-year hiatus in publishing. This was largely because he was working on this book, the 'Critique of Pure Reason'.<br /><br />Kant as a professor of philosophy was familiar with the Rationalists, such as Descartes, who founded the Enlightenment and in many ways started the phenomenon of modern philosophy. He was also familiar with the Empiricist school (John Locke and David Hume are perhaps the best known names in this), which challenged the rationalist framework. Between Leibniz' monads and Hume's development of Empiricism to its logical (and self-destructive) conclusion, coupled with the Romantic ideals typified by Rousseau, the philosophical edifice of the Enlightenment seemed about to topple.<br /><br />Kant rode to the rescue, so to speak. He developed an idea that was a synthesis of Empirical and Rationalist ideas. He developed the idea of a priori knowledge (that coming from pure reasoning) and a posterior knowledge (that coming from experience) and put them together into synthetic a priori statements as being possible. Knowledge, for Kant, comes from a synthesis of pure reason concepts and experience. Pure thought and sense experience were intertwined. However, there were definite limits to knowledge. Appearance/phenomenon was different from Reality/noumena - Kant held that the unknowable was the 'ding-an-sich', roughly translated as the 'thing-in-itself', for we can only know the appearance and categorial aspects of things.<br /><br />Kant was involved heavily in scientific method, including logic and mathematical methods, to try to describe the various aspects of his development. This is part of what makes Kant difficult reading for even the most dedicated of philosophy students and readers. He spends a lot of pages on logical reasoning, including what makes for fallacious and faulty reasoning. He also does a good deal of development on the ideas of God, the soul, and the universe as a whole as being essentially beyond the realm of this new science of metaphysics - these are not things that can be known in terms of the spatiotemporal realm, and thus proofs and constructs about them in reason are bound to fail.<br /><br />Kant does go on to attempt to prove the existence of God and the soul (and other things) from moral grounds, but that these cannot be proved in the scientific methodology of his metaphysics and logic. This book presents Kant's epistemology and a new concept of metaphysics that involves transcendental knowledge, a new category of concepts that aims to prove one proposition as the necessary presupposition of another. This becomes the difficulty for later philosophers, but it does become a matter that needs to be addressed by them.<br /><br />As Kant writes at the end of the text, 'The critical path alone is still open. If the reader has had the courtesy and patience to accompany me along this path, he may now judge for himself whether, if he cares to lend his aid in making this path into a high-road, it may not be possible to achieve before the end of the present century what many centuries have not been able to accomplish; namely, to secure for human reason complete satisfacton in regard to that with which it has all along so eagerly occupied itself, though hitherto in vain.' This is heavy reading, but worthwhile for those who will make the journey with Kant.h hitherto in vain.'

The author attempts to flesh out the story through long quotations, his personal stories, stories of others, and information about McCandless from people who could not have known him well.  Curiously, Krakauer refers often to the photos McCandless took of his surroundings and himself, but only offered one in the book.   <br /> <br />For my two cents, I think Chris McCandless has some mental problems.  He was charismatic and charming with strangers, but had no friends or family that he kept in contact with that he had known for more than two years.  He knew that he would quite possibly die in Alaska, and he did. Was he an explorer, a free spirit, a silly young man, an incompetent egotist?  In the end I didn't really care that much.  It's a sad story and I hope at least that it will serve as a warning for the foolhardy.  Otherwise it would have been better to leave the story alone, let the family get over their grief, and not subject readers to such round-about writing.	2005-10-10

Merwin?  Long acclaimed as one of our most poignant and important poets, his newest collection is an endless stream of homages to fleeting thoughts, ideas, and other delicacies encounter by the informed eye and heart.  Merwin keeps his language simple but continues to prod our senses with challenging concepts.  In these one hundred odd poems he wanders through our perceptions and imaginations and strikes chords familiar and foreign, all with the flowing beauty of his carefully molded words.<br /><br />These poems seem to be odes, not so much to people as to natural matters and objects and notions.  In 'To a Falling Leaf in Winter':  'At sundown when a day's words/ have gathered at the feet of the trees/ lining up in silence/ to enter the long corridors/ of the roots into which they/ pass one by one thinking/ that they remember the place/ as they fell themselves climbing/ away from their only sound/ while they are being forgotten/ by their bright circumstances/ they rise through all the rings/ listening again/ afterward as they/ listened once and they come/ to where the leaves used to live/ during their lives but have gone now/ and they too take the next step/ beyond the reach of meaning.'<br /><br />There are no adequate descriptives for Merwin's gifts.  They are simply there for the savouring of those with quiet hearts to read and hear.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, October 05	2005-10-11

When her father dictates she must enter a convent, she trades places with her brother Thom who is to become a page and eventually a knight.<br /><br />I read the Alanna series as a teenager and was fascinated by her adventures. Now as an adult some of this story seems a tad predictable. Pierce's writing lacks detail and some of her characters (such as the prince, George etc.) are rather clich&eacute; for the fantasy genre. Still, this is a great series of books that young girls and adults will enjoy... I only wish that Pierce had fleshed out her characters a bit more.

In the course of saving them from certain death they learn of an ancient golden treasure that has been lost. They learn they might be able to find it. At the same time some crooked men are learning about this treasure and gathering clues towards finding it as well. And the race is on.<br /><br />Again it is a fun beach read that moves fast.

As he states in the books Afterword, this is his only novel in the Acion/suspence/romance genre.  Actually I thought it was trying to be in the same genre of most of James Patterson books.  The probem I found with the book was that it developed too slowly.  We have the same unanswered questions on page 360 as we had in the beginning.  It's not until the book has as few as 50 pages left does it really get going.  Descriptions of mundane activities is fine.  It ads color and depth to the charactors but I thought it was excessive here.  They got out of the cab, went to the museaum, checked into a hotel, made a phone call, blah blah blah.  Thankfully the whole story gets turned around and it reallly has a stunning conclusion, but it was hard for me to get there.  Interesting read, but I found books like Intensity, and Sole Survivor much more interesting.	2005-10-12

Namely, Stephanos' wedding to Philomena. It provides an excuse for our laconic sleuth to muse in a post-drunken wedding binge that someone might have chucked a sharp knife at him. In turn, this enables him, post-nuptials, to start to think about things other than the sorry state of his interior and exterior dcor, symposiums and solving the odd magpie inspired theft here and there that have not gripped our attention up to this point.   <br />Doody's slow inexorable plot style drags the unwilling reader along again so that by page two hundred or so of the paperback version we find ourselves wondering exactly what task Stephanos and Aristotle are being set by the author other than responding to a trumped-up charge of boundary poaching by the neighbour of his newly extended family. However, lurking furtively in the background is the murder of the helpful Sophilios and, also, Arhkias' disclaimer over the amount of drakhmai he lost in the incident. <br />Doody has Philomela express a desire to join the mysteries of Eleusis and this coincides with Aristotle's slave, for whom his affection grows daily. As the novel progresses we find ourselves bombarded with more and more problems and the clue to it all lies in exactly the fact there is an inundation. Stephanos' stumbles alarmingly through his Eleusian initiation, gets overly raucous in the Agora as he's accused of not fulfilling his previous nuptial agreements, finds himself on the receiving end of a knife thrower and a marble head a few times, up on his own tiles and generally harassed left right and centre as he tries to deal with a spurious land ownership charge by Lykon and locate missing children. <br />By the time we reach our denouement in a pottery shop where we get a quick rash of murders based on the fallings out of a criminal gang, Doody neatly ties up the thievery with Stephano's beleaguered life and we come away satisified that out of the murky randomness was actually a very clever plot. I have to say that I have found the Stephanos mysteries extremely laborious to plow through but this is by far the best so long as you keep gong past page two hundred. It'll be interesting to see if Stephanos continues to improve.	2005-10-12

Even though I have a good graphic designer, I like to come up with the design and color schemes myself, and let him play around with them to get the best results. <br />Actually, before I worked with him, I had first one absolutely awful designer, and then another mediocre one. The first one designed my first book cover based on my design specs, which was OK, but she chose the colors, and I went along with her, not knowing any better. The results were pretty bad - the cover was way too dark, and some of the writing actually got lost in it because it was so dark. <br />That's when I switched over to my second designer, and picked up this gem of a book at the same time. I personally chose the color combos for the second and third books based on the combinations given in the book. Now, the design was basically the same for the first, second, and third covers because they were all part of the same set, but the colors make all the difference. I actually have buyers telling me how attractive the colors on the second and third books are, which is pretty amazing considering that they are just students' workbooks and cover design is usually not considered very important by my audience.

Following an introduction made through the thoughts and observations of a sexual predator, Broken Prey opens with the grizzly murder of a young woman who'd been scourged. Soon after, the sexual murder of a man is discovered. There seems to be little to connect the two until the authorities realize that both crimes included methods used by three currently incarcerated charismatic and powerful killers. <br /> <br />Lucas Davenport, working with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and his friend, Minneapolis Police Detective Sloan, get a crash course on interview techniques of the criminally insane when they visit the \\"Big Three\\" at St. John's hospital in an effort to figure out how they may be influencing the rampant escalation of heinous sex crimes from inside their isolation cells.  <br /> <br />Sandford introduces Ruffee Ignace, an egotistic, career-climbing Tribune reporter who has been contacted by the killer, giving him a public voice. Ignace is ruthless and willing to do anything for the story that will catapult him out of Minneapolis. I'm guessing we'll see him again!  <br /> <br />Luckily there are moments throughout the story like Davenport's search for the 100 Best Songs of the Rock Era for his new IPod. Most of the characters add their two cents worth, putting as much into their list choice as they do crime solving! Or there's Lucas' struggle to follow his Doctor-wife's \\"nutritional guidelines.\\" Lucas went home and ate a steak and onion low carb, low-fat microwave meal \\"that had apparently been purely made from coal tar and goobers perhaps seasoned with industrial phlegm.\\"  <br /> <br />Armchair Inteviews says: These humorous things provide welcome respites from the stress of wondering how close Sanford's plot follows real life psychotic sex murderers! As always, Sanford tells a good crime story! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

With the publication of \\"The da Vinci Code,\\" a substantial corollary of publishing flotsam and jetsam has spread, encompassing \\"The Name of the Rose\\", and \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" among other worthwhile enterprises. Martin Gardiner inspired this auxiliary niche much earlier with his magnificent tomes deconstructing the Dodson oeuvre. Even Samuel Clemens has his explainers establishing that decoding Grimm is grim indeed.<br /><br />Hence, this book is a handy reference to seeing which real life Karlas were confabulating into Littell's Starik (Old Man). Littell derived the title from Jan Berzin, p.201, the successor to Feliks Dzerzhinsky, the original landlord of Lubyanka. Starik's Lolita propensities, which Littell uses as a recurring obsessive liet motif, were derived from Beria, who \\"could indulge his vices, the chief one of which was little girls. Beria had little girls kidnapped all over Moscow; they were taken to his luxurious dacha, where he raped them.\\" P. 214.<br /><br />Littell used Marcus Wolfe to demonstrate the unknown quality of Starik, the superspy model for Le Carre's Karla in the Smiley sagas, p. 177, and of course, Jack J. McAuliffe, is James Bond, ala Ian Fleming, in real life Dusko (not the ill-fated Pyotr, p.35, who suffered a furnace fire execution) Popov[e], pp. 98-102.<br /><br />Ernest Volkman, a prize-winning former national correspondent for Newsday, spices up this book by pointing out that Giovanni Montini was a praised and prize covert asset for the CIA before he was elected Pope Paul VI and was nominated for sainthood recognition by John Paul II who was overt except for the covert funding of Solidarity, p. 276.<br /><br />Volkman does not resolve the still unanswered question as to whether Jesus Angleton was \\"Sasha\\" and used his devoted acolyte Golitsin to discredit Nosenko, who was tortured by Angleton, ala Littell's Leo Kritsky. However, Volkman's \\"Spies\\" was published in 1974, some eighteen years before Littell's \\"The Company\\" (2002).<br /><br />A two page update to Volkman, can be found in Freeh's not quite maxima mea culpa, \\"My FBI [Feebi]\\" (2005), which notes that Aldrich Ames was head of the firm's Soviet Branch of the Directorate of Operations in 1985, eleven years after Angleton was fired, whilst discussing Bob Hanssen and Earl Pitts.

It goes without saying that they are thrilled, but that does not last long. Charlie is kidnapped, and his parents, Claudio, King Boris, Sergie, Ninu and two lions promptly take off after him.<br /><br />The Truth was really good, though not as good as the first book. There was not as much humor, tension or the exhalent conversations between Charlie and the lions. Sergie was in this book, but he was not as prominent as in the other two books, I really missed that. There was not as much conversation between Charlie's parents. Primo was in this book, but only briefly. I really missed all those parts, and also the fact that the characters did not seem as bright as in the previous books. But the thing I liked least was the beginning, on the beginning Charlie's parents make some very dumb choices, without those choices the plot would almost be impossible, but they come off as cheesy because of the brilliance these people have already shown. I did like Ninu, but a chameleon, especially when it does not have as much character as the lions, is really no substitute for the lions.<br /><br />If you liked the other two books I would probably recommend this book  because of some of the resolutions in the climax. If you Have not read `Lionboy' and `Lionboy the Chase' you will get nothing out of this book. If you haven't read those books I would HIGHLY recommend them before you read this book.	2005-10-12

Virtually nothing goes right for the poor human and ilderan characters.  The chain of unlikly setbacks some of these characters endure are second only to the plotlines in the TV series 24 in inprobability. Whats worse, our hero's reactions are totally ineffective, their strategies irrational.  I can only assume Anderson is planning on some alien rescuers like the Wentals to bail them out. <br /> <br />Another problem with the books as they progress is how much time Anderson spends rehashing events that have already happened.  It seems like every event has to be first described, and then reminisced about by a character at least twice before he is satisfied we caught the even't significance! <br /> <br />All that said, this series has kept my interest, I do enjoy it, but I think Anderson could have done a lot better.  There are many things that don't make sense in the book, like how these civilizations  could accomplish much of anything with no faster-than light communications.  I guess any ship whose star drive happens to break down is just out of luck.  Also, the stupidity displayed by the supposedly tactical and sharp minded Ad'ar Zahn is really frustrating.  Overall, the good side in these novels seem incapable of any real innovation or capability to drive events, they merely react mechanically.  Only rarely do they display creativity. <br /> <br />Making matters much worse for this audiobook, there is a different, and far less talented reader.  Apparently this guy took over without bothering to listen to any of George Guidall's recordings.  Most of the place and character names are pronounced differently.  The roamers now all seem to come from the american deep south, and sound both stupid and ridiculous as a result.  The Ilderans talk in maddening fake english accents.  The readers attempts at both gruff, gravely voices and female voices come off pretty pathetic as well.  Since one of mymain motivations for listening to this series was Guidall's comforting rythms, this book has been painful at times. <br /> <br />I would still recommend this book however, just because it is relatively easy to skip through the utterly mechanical and predictable, or repetitive parts because the chapters are arranged by character.  Sometimes it becomes easy to predit what will happen in a given chapter and just skip it if it will be too painful to read. <br /> <br />If your a person that demands better written books, or needs a more positive storyline, I'd steer clear.  On the other hand if you enjoy tragedy and psychology, as well as interesting aliens and a good sense of the unknown, I would recommend this book to you.	2005-10-14

Michael Connelly's \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is the author's first foray into the legal thriller genre.  He has already proven himself a master of the police procedural with his marvelous Harry Bosch series. This novel introduces California criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller, a man with two ex-wives and an eight-year-old daughter named Hayley.  Mickey is known as a sleazy lawyer who lives on the edge, barely managing to make ends meet by defending drug dealers, junkies, and an occasional accused murderer.<br /><br />To Mickey, \\"the law was not about truth.  It was about negotiation, amelioration, manipulation.\\"  It is a good day for Mickey when he gets a guilty client off on a technicality.  He enjoys punching holes in the prosecution's cases and the cops and district attorneys hate his guts.  Mickey's most deep-seated fear is one that he inherited from his father, who was a prominent lawyer for almost thirty years--the fear of failing to protect an innocent client from being sent to prison.<br /><br />Haller, who does much of his work out of his Lincoln Town Car, is now busier than ever.  He has a new client named Louis Roulet, who was arrested for aggravated assault and attempted rape, and the suspect's family is filthy rich.  When Roulet asks Haller to represent him, the lawyer immediately sees dollar signs dancing before his eyes.  This might be the big score, or as Mickey likes to say, \\"the gift that keeps on giving,\\" with legal fees that could climb well into the six figures.  Little does Mickey know that by taking this case, he will be jeopardizing his career as well as his life. The unexpected fallout will change the way that Mickey views himself and the law forever.<br /><br />Connelly does a masterful job of setting up an intricate narrative that features believable characters, crisp dialogue, and compelling courtroom scenes.  \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is funny, brash, cynical, suspenseful, and at times, shocking.  I have some reservations about the plot, which has gaping holes that are never filled.  However, this is a book with bite.  It is an entertaining, thought-provoking, and immensely satisfying novel that is sure to be huge hit.at are never filled.  However, this is a book with bite.

Welsh is a wonderful, ancient language that has survived on the fringe of the island of Great Britain despite the dominance of its now world-wide-dominant neighbour, English.  The literary works, particularly the poetry, has great power, even when translated into English, and English speakers can get a sense of the flavour of this Celtic language from the various worlds that have been absorbed into English.<br /><br />This course created by T. J. Rhys Jones (about as Welsh a name as they come) is a very easy, step-by-step process to learn what is in many ways a very difficult language - particularly for English speakers, whose language comes from Germanic and Latinate roots, going to a Celtic language which stems from a different tree is truly an excursion into foreign territory.  Rhys Jones has made this trip quite enjoyable, and quite do-able.<br /><br />Unlike English, Welsh pronunciation is a lot less flexible in terms of matching spelling to sound, so learning the pronunciation is a bit easier to do.  The grammar seciont also looks at the way words are put together - like many languages, there are colloquial expressions and multi-word phrases that stand in for single English words, and vice-versa.  Each unit starts with a brief dialogue, which is then analysed for vocabulary and for grammar structure, and any other points of interest.<br /><br />There is also an introductory section on mutations, the shift of a sound from one to another depending upon use - Rhys Jones gives the examples of road signs:  the word for Wales is Cymru, but a border sign when crossing into Wales might read Croeso i Gymru; similarly, the word for England is Lloegr, but the sign might read Croeso i Loegr.  This is a codification in letters of what happens in regular speech - we do not as a rule stop and start between each word, and the spelling in Welsh takes this into account.<br /><br />There are a few difficulties with the text. While Rhys Jones indicates that there are dialect differences, some of the words don't match what I heard while in Wales in any location.  As with any language text, I am more often to account the difficulty to myself than to the author of the instructional text.<br /><br />There is a glossary of words in the back, but I often found myself wishing it were a fuller dictionary rather than a simple word list.  There are exercises to work through, whose translations are found in the appendix, as well as more detailed tables on mutations, gender in language constructions, the special verb 'have', which in Welsh can be variously translated as gyda, cael, wedi, or rhaid.<br /><br />This is a useful text; used in connection with travel or a book of poetry (Dafydd ap Gwilym is one of my favourite poets).dialect differences, some of the words don't match what I heard while in Wales in any location.

Unlike Herbert/Anderson's previous \\"Dune\\" trilogy, this time around the second book is not only as good as the first, it's quite a bit better.  Sadly, the main problem from \\"the Butlerian Jihad\\" is held over: Herbert/Anderson BADLY need a competent editor.  There are so many badly written sentences (and a few out-and-out grammatical errors) that it became distracting. <br /> <br />Luckily, the plot is sufficiently good to keep me from being distracted for long.  Once again, I can't honestly say that it meshes up perfectly with Frank Herbert's work, but on its own, this is a pretty gripping sci-fi epic, with memorable characters (I'm particularly fond of Erasmus, one of the better villains I've read in a while) and a satisfying ambition. <br /> <br />Maybe future editions can clean up some of the sloppy prose and correct some of the errors.  It's a shame for a fundamentally good work to be marred by material that is entirely fixable.	2005-10-08

The Baroque cycle is a study in intricate plots, characters that seem to number in the thousands, and difficult material that is not readily accessible to the average novel reader.  The Cryptonomicon met that description as well, but to a lesser degree.  While I enjoyed those books precisely for their complexity, many readers probably found them to be frustrating to read and difficult to follow. <br />  <br />The Stephen Bury novels do not present this problem for the casual reader.  They are stripped of most of the technical lingo, and they tend to follow more in the footsteps of modern thrillers.  The difference between these novels and the average Tom Clancy clone is that they revolve around powerful critiques of modern political cultures and bureacracies. <br /> <br />The Cobweb is the better of these two novels.  The central critique of the intelligence community is that competence without political acumen is tantamount to career suicide.  The book tracks the months between Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and the start of Gulf War I and poses a terrifying question: what if the greatest enemies to our national security are the egomaniacs at the top of the security apparatus?  Given the events that have transpired in between the writing of this novel and today, the question raised by this novel seems prescient. <br /> <br />The one thing that is lacking from the Stephen Bury novels is the decadence of Stephenson's other works.  Stephenson is a novelist who has spent pages discussing the Captain Crunch-eating ritual of one of his characters (Cryptonomicon), the making of watered steel blades (the Baroque Cycle), and other incidental but vastly entertaining subjects too numerous to mention.  These passages exquisitely sideline the plots of his books for an exercise in pure intellectual indulgence.  Sadly, you will not find any such passages in this novel or in Interface.	2005-10-14

There are so many dynamics going on in the show (such as short term goals, i.e. winning the assignment; relating to team members; and of course dealing with The Donald, and his side kicks George and Carolyn), that makes it compelling viewing all around. Don't underestimate the Donald's factor. For proof, check the oh-so-lame new Martha Stewart Apprentice show.... boring!!!<br /><br />\\"Lessons from the Apprentice: Secrets to Success from the Boardroom to the Business World\\" (176 pages) is a high-end, glossy page book that takes you back to the first 3 seasons of \\"The Apprentice\\". While the book is structured to offer \\"lessons\\", it really is a fun look back of what worked and what went horribly wrong in the teams various assignments. With 20-20 vision, many of the mistakes that the losing teams made were so obvious (Ivana dropping her pants to \\"sell\\" chocolate bars? Danny's \\"Triple Play\\" act to get people into Burger King? etc.). There are plenty of pictures and quotes from the Donald, George and Carolyn, but also from the various business executives whose company products were on the line, and in that sense, yes, the book offers lessons.<br /><br />In the end, though, this is an irreverent look back at the first three seasons of \\"The Apprentice\\", and a good one at that. In a way, it reminds me of the 3 (so far) Simpsons books that \\"dissect\\" the episodes. If you are a fan of \\"The Apprentice\\", you will love this book!	2005-10-09

Schor's Born to Buy offers an in-depth examination of the way marketers target minors.  (Inexplicably, between hardback and soft cover it lost its subtitle: \\"The Commercialized Child and the New Consumer Culture.\\")  Some of it was enlightening; some of it was shocking; most of it was convincing; all of it was pretty interesting.  Schor may be a bit too speculative about the impact of commercialization from time to time, but even so she has the potential to spark dialogue, which is something society sorely needs in respect to the way we're brainwashing our children.  I live in a consumer-savvy household.  I've been educating my son since he was old enough to watch commercial television about the aims of marketers and the ways commercials mislead you.  Even so he's a patsy for every slick snake-oil salesman that comes along.  And it is disturbing that while I myself choose what to expose him to on television and in magazines that he reads at home, he might be forced to sit through advertisements in his classroom with no one to offer a balanced perspective on advertiser claims.  The halls of junior academia should most decidedly be safe zones, and commercial enterprises should not be allowed to bribe our educators into subverting the public trust.  Anyway, enough with my soap box.  Schor is better positioned on hers.<br /><br />I'd give this one 4.5 stars if Amazon would let me. Since it won't, I'll overlook what I perceive as minor weaknesses because they have little impact to the overall appeal and influence of the work.	2005-10-11

Volume II contains The Thousand Cities, which is told from the Marukaner General Abivard's point of view, and Videssos Besieged, which is told by his counterpart (and foe) the Videssian Emperor. Abivard has come  up in the world since the first book in the series (see Time of Troubles I for The Stolen Throne).  Now the General to King Sharbaraz, Abivard finds his problems have gotten more difficult.  While he has successfully invaded all the Westlands of Videssos, he cannot find a way to cross the sea into the capital.  Meanwhile the Videssan army is now striking back, using their navy to place troops wherever they wish.  King Sharbaraz expects Abivard to win more and more battles while offering fewer resources and troops.  And his wife Roshnani, while always offering able counsel, contines to urge big changes in Marukan society.   <br /> <br />Videssos Besieged is again told by now-Emperor Maniakes, who is losing support as the war continues to falter.  Tax revenues are almost non-existant with the Marukan army occupying most of the West, and the Kubrati invading from the North.  Now he's losing the support of the priests and the people for committing incest; he married his first cousin and he's quite happy about it.  Turtledove shows us his background as a technical writer in spending far too long describing a magical spell in forging a document that's just a fantasy version of cut and paste using an actual (squeak!) mouse. <br /> <br />Once again the books closely follow the history of the Byzantine Empire, with magic overlayed here and there. This is the same formula, history meets fantasy, used in the Darkness series (which retold World War II as a sword and sorcery epic) and the Peachtree trilogy (The US Civil War). Turtledove, as always, does it well. <br /> <br />I can't give the book (the two novels) five stars because the characters are too similar to Turtledove's other heroes: logical-thinking straight-talking types married to women much like themselves. The characters observe repeatedly that war kills people, that women do battle in the birthing bed, and that people are people the world over. The books are enjoyable but don't make the leap to profound.	2005-10-10

It's amazing how most of the book's haters desperately try to defend the current system that is turning America into a falling empire. No, Frank does not talk down voters. The book's bashers misunderstand that Frank could care less about people's take on culture issues like guns and abortion. It's how both conservatives and liberals have used cultural populism to write off the economy. Frank pretty much pounds both sides for distracting voters with social and personal issues such as guns, abortion, patriotism, etc ... Of course, \\"conservatives\\" have won the culture war. Roe v Wade will never be overturned although Congress and the president along with most states have already made it irrelevant by creating barriers against women's rights to decide how to handle unwanted pregnancies. Instead, as has been the case with Bush's recent nominees, Roberts and Miers, it's all about allowing corrupt business practices to control America to the point of destruction. Frank's interviews with voters in the book have generally shown that most social conservative voters would still vote Democrat because they could count on them to protect their economic sanity. But year after year as Democrats voted lockstep with the GOP on tax cuts for the elite, \\"free trade\\", deregulation, etc ... social issues would control the way they vote for politicians. Thus, the voters' inclination to vote against their own economic interests has pervaded Kansas and continues to pervade much of America. There is one thing Frank never mentions in this book at least. Much of these same lower and middle class voters are hoodwinked by these same \\"conservatives\\" into believing that they too will be rich like the elitists as long as they vote \\"conservative\\". Trouble is these voters end up losing what's left for them to defend and in the process pushing themselves into the LOSING class or further into it. If the Democrats can't take bold initiatives and return to campaigning and legislating like economic populists, expect the \\"conservative\\" frauds to win office after office.	2005-10-10

Reviewer: Waldir Freitas Oliveira (Salvador, Bahia, Brazil)	On purpose  of commemorating the fourth centenary of the birth of the Spanish dramatist Tirso de Molina, the Department of Modern Language and Literature of The Catholic University of America, sponsored a so-called The International Symposium on Tirso de Molina, which was organized by Dr. Joseph M. Sola-Sol, assistant professor, and took place in Washington D.C. in November 1988. One of the academic byproducts of that event is the volume Tirso's Dons Juan, Metamorphoses of a Theme, edited bu Joseph M. Sola-Sol and George E. Gingras, associate professor, and published in Washington D.C. The Catholic University of America, 1988. It assembles numerous scholary contributions then presented by well-known specialists in Hispanic Literature, although dealing with a single and specific the: Don Juan, the character and theatrical personage. As such, this book remains referred to as rare collection of high quality level studies on the subject.  <br />I'ts hard task to distinguish any of the thirteen articles selected for this publication, because each one or them is worth enough to be summed up as unique in the meaningful conjoint of texts. A relevant theme as Tirso de Molina and his provocative personage, Don Juan, justify the value of this book as a whole. DThe erudition of the authors of the articles assembled by the book constitutes, as ma matter of fact, the most efficient factor for its success in the realm of literature, along with the appropriate viewpoints and approache adopted by the authors for analyzing and understanding the Spanish dramaturgical creation of Don Juan, undoubtedly one of the most famous characters os hero-villain of the world literature. In this book the article \\"The present state of Studies on the Don Juan\\", written by Armand Singer, of West Virginia University, deserves a special mention for having presented the most complete bibliography ever inlisted on the theme, and amplified after his research-book \\"The Don Juan Theme, Versions and Criticism: a Bibliography\\" (Morgantown, West Virginia Univesity Press, 1965) and is subsequent \\"Supplements\\", all of them published in the WVUPP, in 1966, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1980 and 198. The article \\"Some Observations on the Generic Status of the Don Juan Theme from Tirso de Molina to Mozart\\", signed by George E.Gingras, an associate professor of the Department of Modern Language and Literature of the Catholic University of America, by examining the problem of generic displacement performed by the theme in a variety of neoclassical dramatic and musical forms, also deserves another distinguishid mention.	2005-10-12

The one drawback to this book is that you will need to have a specialized understanding of the art and science of war. If you are a novice, buy the book and continue to do your research and professional reading. This book will become invaluable to you later and you will be grateful that you have it.  Side bar... of course you might not agree with everything that this author says; thats ok, look past that and focus on the content of what he is trying to convey.<br /><br />Of particular note, What I like about this book is that it is organized and fits nicely with the notion that there are \\"many\\" centers of gravity. for those that believe, like myself, that clausewitz had more than just a narrow defintion of how the principles of war were tied to more than just the political, then this book will become an excellent source reference for your continuing professional development as you explore the nuances and variables of the many types of strategies. All in all, this book is worth the effort.<br /><br />Terry Tucker, Prof Military Studies/History<br /><br />Senior Doctrine Developer, SANGMP	2005-10-13

But I was hoping for much more about Butkus's life off the football field. I would have liked to have heard more anecdotes about players he played with and against. Also would have been interesting to hear personal insights from Dick regarding what he felt about the awe-like reputation he inspired on the field from fans and players alike. <br /> <br />This reads too much as a season-by-season and game-by-game account of his career.

In the current field, filled with recollections of growing up in alcoholic, schizophrenic and other dysfunctional families, Daniel Becker's book stands out as a straight-forward story about growing up with an anorexic mother and it's effects on his brothers, his father and himself. Becker's mother was diagnosed with adult anorexia at a time when very few had heard of the word much less knew how to spell it. The author  not only provides the reader with a great deal of information about the disease but writes about its consequences upon the entire family dynamic.  Above all, this is an honest attempt by Becker to make sense of his own childhood as well as This Mean Disease's effect on his adult life.   <br />	2005-10-12

Judy Sheehan has a distinct style that makes the dialogue and even the narration read like real life, which, in turn, makes the characters come to life even more fully. Because this is very much a character-driven novel, you are pulled into Jane's struggles and deluged with her life as if you were living it. Sheehan captures the daily life of a single woman living in New York perfectly and more wonderfully describes the adoption process. Personally, I never knew that much about adoption, but after reading this book, I feel as if I was introduced to another world, and coming away from that, I now have a newfound respect for anyone who chooses to adopt. All in all, it's hard to read this book and not be drawn into Jane Howe's struggles, friendships, and bad dates, all of which are described with delightfully witty imagery.	2005-10-09

The Circuit is about a family that lived in El Rancho Blanco, Guadalajara. Francisco and his family moved to the United States crossing the border illegally. When they get to the United States in California they look for work and they work in the fields picking cotton. Francisco's family is always hiding from the border patrol which they call it \\"la migra.\\" As they go on they move to different places. The reason I read this story is because it held my interest , because I wondered how it would be crossing the border illegally. Also, because some of the story reminds me about when I got here from Mexico.  I really recommend this book.  It's exciting and it taught me to eat all my food and not throw it away because Francisco's family did't have anything to eat sometimes. I would give this book a ten, and I really loved it a lot and I think you should try it.	2005-10-13

If this describes you, think again! After reading this book, I will never again be able to think of the issue as \\"black-and-white\\" or Charismatic doctrines as \\"obviously\\" proven. In this book, Warfield: <br />1. Examines church history and various \\"examples\\" of miracles, such as \\"mind-cure\\" miracles (like those of Christian Science), Roman Catholic miracles, etc., and shows that we are in no way obligated to believe them, and that the case for these miracles is weak at best. In one particular section of the book, Warfield takes several examples of Christian \\"miracles\\" and gives examples of similar miracles being performed through other movements/factors, such as mesmerism, placebo effect, suggestion, and non-Christian religions. Warfield also critiques several miracle \\"movements.\\" For example, his critique of the Christian Science movement was extremely interesting and informative; for example, Warfield shows how Christian Science is not really Christian at all, but is really a form of pantheism. <br />2. Shows that many of the common proof-texts of the Charismatic movement do not really support their position. <br />3. Shows that the Bible actually supports the cessation of the charisma. <br />My one point against this book: I think that Warfield's arguments on the third point are fairly strong, but could maybe a little stronger. He does an excellent job refuting his opponents' views, but his arguments for his position related to the third position could be a little more in-depth. In all fairness though I am not sure that his primary purpose was simply to write an exegetical case for cessationism, and his arguments are strong in my opinion. <br /> <br />I woulddefinitly recommend this book to anyone who thinks that there is \\"clear\\" Scriptural or historical evidence for the charismatic movement, or who is dealing with the charismatic movement or has friends/family in the charismatic movement.	2005-10-11

Beginner's Chinese has some good points.  It comes with two CDs featuring native speakers -- one for the lessons and one for Chinese syllable practice.  Simplified characters and pinyin are provided together for all material in the book. Each lesson has a good collection of exercises for translation, ad hoc response to questions, and grammar.  A Cultural Insights section that addresses some aspect of Chinese society caps each lesson.  The book has a pinyin-Wade Giles cross reference that is very helpful for English-speaking students. <br /> <br />But there are definitely areas for improvement.  This is a second edition.  The third edition could be a great book.  First, the CDs.  The CDs are indispensable, but each lesson takes up only a bit over three minutes.  No time is left between sentences for the student to practice pronunciation.  (The words can be pronounced if the student hurries.)  And then there is the organization.  On the CDs, first comes vocabulary, then sentence patterns, then conversations.  In the book, the order is sentence patterns, conversations, then vocabulary.  It would be nice if they were consistent and went through the lesson in order.  Much more use could have been made of the CDs, but here we get into a critique of the book itself. <br /> <br />In general, there is not enough practice material.  For example, in each chapter there is a list of \\"supplementary\\" words and expressions.  These are not used in the spoken exercises except to pronounce them once on the CD. <br /> <br />In the place of more practice material each chapter has extensive \\"language points\\" where the author sometimes belabors subtle linguistic points that, in my opinion, could be done without in an introductory text.  Here also is where speech patterns are discussed. In the actual Sentence Patterns section introducing each lesson, each \\"pattern\\" is given once, leaving the student to infer what the patterns are.  Most have the impression that the pattern sentences are just a collection of unique sentences.  Here is where more material should be added by giving additional examples of each pattern where such is possible. <br /> <br />In summary: <br /> <br />1. Remove the \\"supplementary\\" words and expressions section and just include it in the lesson vocabulary if individual words are important enough to include. <br />2. Make explicit what the pattern is for each pattern sentence. <br />Provide up to ten or twelve examples with each pattern using all the vocabulary introduced to that point. <br />3. Remove some of the show-off linguistics discussions and save them for a class on Chinese linguistics. <br />4. Include all the expanded practice material on the CDs with time for the students to repeat each sentence.  Since this may disrupt the continuity of the Conversations, I would suggest recording that section twice: first at normal conversation speed without breaks for comprehension practice; then a second time with a pause after each line so students can practice pronunciation.  If something has to go, do away with the Chinese syllable practice on the second CD, and continue the lessons on that CD.  It's more important for the students to get their syllable practice on their actual vocabulary rather than be able to recite the universe of abstract ba, bo, bi's. <br /> <br />If you are an instructor, realize that you are going to have to make up additional material to provide pattern and \\"supplementary\\" vocabulary practice and listen to student complaints about the CDs.  And hope the students don't lose their way or become discouraged trying to plough through the abstruse Language Points. <br />	2005-10-09

I read every book that comes out and this one is going to make a big difference in new riders lives. <br /> <br />This book has everything a rider needs to know to get started: preparation, picking out a bike and riding gear, how to work the controls, how to practice, when to take a rider training course, what to do after you get your license, how to get better and get familiar with different types of roads and traffic, safe riding procedures, and more.  <br /> <br />What's really cool is the way Mr Hahn reveals some of the mysteries of riding (countersteering, mental overload, what other books to read along the way) and also attacks some myths that go along with riding, like \\"If I had to explain, you wouldn't understand\\" and \\"laying it down\\" and \\"there are two kinds of riders\\" etc.  <br /> <br />Rider attitudes one through four will keep me alive for a long long time, even for an experienced rider I was surprised how much I learned about attitude and evaluating my ability. <br /> <br />There's also a section with drills and stuff to practice on your own after you take the MSF course but before you really head out into traffic. You could probably do these drills whether or not you took the course. <br /> <br />It's easy to read, too, and humorous at times, not as funny as his other book, but this one has way cooler photos and diagrams and important advice for hungry new riders. Anybody who's thinking about getting into riding, or anybody who has been been riding for less than two years should get this book. <br /> <br />I'll be loaning my copy to my nephew when he turns 16.

Fitzmyer, S.J.<br /><br />I've been reading his stuff for years.  Fitzmyer is scholarly, somewhat dry, and impeccably honest.  His academic credentials are first-rate.  He's one of the major contributors (in partnership with the legendary Scripture scholar Raymond E. Brown) to the New Jerusalem Biblical Commentary, as well as a number of critical commentaries in the Anchor Bible series (including the mighty tome on Paul's epistle to the Romans).<br /><br />In this collections of essays published in 2000, some reworked in a salutary fashion to meet modern standards, Fr. Fitzmyer first sets up his methodology, explaining to the reader how he comes to his conclusions from the weath of data available.  Some of the most interesting essays include \\"The Aramaic 'Son of God' Text from Qumran Cave 4\\" (in which he examines the title \\"Son of God\\" and its various flavors in this Semitic literature), the related article \\"The Background of 'Son of God' as a Title for Jesus\\" (in which Fitzmyer examines the Semitic - as opposed to Greek Septuagintal - context for \\"Son of God\\" in the New Testament in the light of the scrolls), and \\"Qumran Messianism\\" in which the often otherwise oversimplified messianic references are further explored and qualified.  I also enjoyed the \\"Tobit\\" essays inasmuch as they demonstrate the value of what many Christians and Jews consider extra-canonical literature to the keepers of the scrolls.<br /><br />In short, Fitzmyer shoots down both those who say the scrolls have nothing to do with Christianity, and those who say that figures like John the Baptist and Jesus himself show up in coded fashion in those same scrolls.  Fr. Fitzmyer also paints a context in which the Jewishness of what we Christians call the New Testament plays a fundamental role.	2005-10-10

In \\"Notes from a Small Island,\\" he captures the experience of Great Britain, his own unique journey through it, and his own personality equally well.  He doesn't infuse the book with so much of himself that it becomes annoying, but just enough to give it character and an honest-to-goodness perspective.<br /><br />Bryson writes with a sharp wit that is seldom absent, and it's hard to read this book without wanting to laugh out loud and annoy those around you by reading short passages of it to them.  He points out some of the absurdities of Great Britain and its people, but is equally unafraid to turn that razor wit against himself and point out that he is no less absurd at times.  It's Bryson's sense of humour that makes this book so eminenetly entertaining, the sort of wit that most writers wish they could attain.<br /><br />Even so, Bryson has his serious moments too, and he uses them to showcase the Britain he knows and loves in all its understated glory. He's got an admirable eye for detail and an obvious love for the history of the British Isles, and these things exude from every chapter of the book.  In his travels across the United Kingdom, Bryson seems to prefer the small places, the places nobody goes much or talks about, places like Weston-super-Mare and Durham and John o'Groats and Bournemouth, and he gives we the readers a delightful look into some of the nooks and crannies in each of these places.  To be sure, he visits some of the big cities as well, like Edinburgh, Glasgow, and London of course...but his affections clearly lie in the out-of-the-way places, the ones that maintain a sense of their history and their character.<br /><br />It seems to me that \\"Notes from a Small Island\\" is an ideal book for both those who have lived in Great Britain and those who have never even been there.  For the former, Bryson provides a unique perspective and a clear love for the country, which any resident should be able to appreciate.  For the latter, his salient and funny points will help steer you in surprising directions, one which your average tour book wouldn't be able to recommend.<br /><br />I myself purchased \\"Notes from a Small Island\\" while in London, on a two-week holiday in Great Britain with my family.  I waited a while after I got back to read it, and when I finally did pick it up I found that it made me yearn to go back even more than I already was.  Bryson's descriptions of the land and the people, all the idiosyncracies that makes Great Britain what it is, and his sense of humour throughout the book, made me miss that place mightily.<br /><br />It makes me want to go back and see it all again...but this time, like he did.he former, Bryson provides a unique perspective and a clear love for the country, which any resident should be able to appreciate.

I can only recommend it for anyone who read and believed Power vs Force so they can decide for themselves how much truth is in his form of kenisiology. Also, each needs to be warned that if they are seeking a purely spiritual book, be prepared this is book is also full of a lot of politics. <br />   I had imagined that this book would be merely lists of Dr. Hawkins' Level of Calibrations (LOC's) of people, places and things. Had it been so, perhaps I may not have questioned its content. Ironically, coming from a man who says the fastest way to reach God is to give up every positionality to God, this book is full of.........positionalities. And for someone who has supposedly let go of his ego, this book is full of it. I personally would have called this book the \\"Hawkins Pontifications\\" but perhaps \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\"  IS the most revealing title. <br />    As pointed out in other reviews, his political biases are extremely conservative. He exposes his flawed kenisiology method within his sources he uses to defend his LOC's (ie. opinions), especially glaring in the political arena. For example, page 206 he uses Bill O\\"Reilly(2005) as his source that \\"[spreading memes and their disguised hatred] is now being played by Far Left financiers of organized extremist attacks that plant spurious stories with a network of `bloggers'\\". Apparently Hawkins (I doubt Bill O'Reilly) is completely unaware how many far right blogs exist on the internet. Its this lack of balance, found throughout this book, which screams at the \\"falsehood\\" of many of his arguments. <br />    Normally I would not point out errors found in manuscripts, however Hawkins has heralded his kenisiology to catch all errors and \\"falsehoods\\" by \\"testing\\" every sentence in a book before it goes to publication. Therefore, it is glaringly obtuse that he would list (pg 32) snakes, alligators, dinosaurs, song birds and doves as PREDATORY MAMMALS and cats, family cats and dogs as GRAZERS. (He says that grazers have higher LOC's than predators but cats and dogs rated pretty high, even though cats are obligate carnivores and canines are also in the order carnivore.- Mine eat a mostly raw meaty bones diet). It seems that if you cannot resolve a carnivore having a high LOC, you resolve it by listing them as a grazer!! I bring up this LOC specifically because it is objectively and scientifically wrong, and therefore should have been easily caught, and can easily be pointed out. All other LOC's in the book are subjective and opinionated, and are so numerous the ideas/sources/biases could be debated ad nauseum.  <br />    It becomes obvious to me that all he is testing is his emotional response to any subject.  <br />    Perhaps this explains how he rates great Saints and Sages in the 700's yet his own writings in the high 900s (with the highest and Christ being 1000). It would explain how he vacillates in his opinions, er,... I mean LOC's, of many ideas- from his ratings on astrology changing from a radio program to this book, and those on Gandhi's ideas of changing politics without war in previous writings certainly changing with this book, which dismisses non violence and argues for war. Other opinions also contradict within the book itself. <br />     That this is simply emotional testing could also explain why one reviewer of Power vs Force found her friends tested strong to the thought of saccharin (maybe they thought it would help them lose weight), as compared to real kenisiolgy when held against the body would make one weak. In my own experience while testing with my husband, we can get completely different LOC's on the same subject and question depending on how we each feel about it. And although Hawkins recommends in Power vs Force to use his methods for business, I warn that this can be self delusional and may lead to bad business decisions. <br />     Kenisiology in its original physical-body-test application isnot innately flawed, in my opinion.  Hawkins' mind-thought application of it does not work/tap into the highest universal mind. (God considers Fox news to be more integritous (380) than Dan Rather(205)?And the BBC to be only 15 pts above al-Jazeera?) (Pg 113) If Hawkins does achieve consistency within his close circle of testers, I agree with another reviewer that it is very possible he is subconsciously energetically influencing those around him. Or perhaps, like some political pundits, only surrounds himself with those who agree with him. <br />    I disagree with reviewers who choose to accept his religious calibrations and not his political ones. Hawkins has presented this as the \\"Truth\\", take it or leave it. In this framework, if you question some parts, you must do the same to all calibrations. <br />    Hawkins' strength is in his experiential teachings, such as his book, \\"I\\". This is the only book of his I can now recommend, although there are many more spiritual teachings I would now put ahead of even this book. <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

This was just the kind of romance novel I love. Wonderful characters. Characters that seem real because they are not perfect-something most novels like this lack. There are interesting plot twists and we get to know several secondary characters well. The secondary characters are not boring. The chemistry between Brianna and Michael was very sensual and immediate. The heroine is the perfect foil for the hero's cynicism and intellect. It was written with an amazing level of intensity and feeling that my heart was pumping furiously with both the palatable passion and the keen sense of danger infused in the story. Brianna and Michael were both wounded, intriguing, complex, wonderful characters. The action/suspense was fast-paced and thrilling. The setting was beautiful and exotic. The sex was HOT and perfect for the story. Melody Thomas stories are humorous, romantic and interesting - and she is excellent and creating characters that are real, interesting people - and that you remember vividly from book to book throughout the series. You want to know them better! I love the Donally family. This is the second book I have read from Melody Thomas and I love them both. I'm looking forward to reading more about the Donally family. All I can say in conclusion is if you like a good, emotional, heart-tugging historical, with characters that leap off the pages, buy  Must Have Been The Moonlight.	2005-10-14

What country's health care system offers the best health services in the world, is constantly criticized for not being accessible enough, and yet is so accessible that overuse is leading to runaway costs? The first part of the riddle reveals that the answer could only be America. The remainder gives the contours of a paradox that vexes policymakers year in and year out. Welcome to health care, American-style.... To carry the health care debate on its next lap, America first needs a clear, well-informed, and well-reasoned analysis of the apparent paradox of its health care system. And it needs an agenda for reform that respects the wonders that modern medicine has developed and the creative market processes that deliver them. Cannon and Tanner offer proposals that would further tap the power of markets to make health care more valuable and more affordable. That makes Healthy Competition essential reading.\\"<br />--George P. Shultz, Former Secretary of State, from the foreword<br /><br />\\"Surprisingly readable, extraordinarily comprehensive, highly persuasive.

Although the word hadn't yet entered everyday language when William James published Pragmatism in 1907, the philosopher believed its doctrine had virtually become common sense in twentieth-century America.  For James, pragmatism was a specific philosophical alternative to essentialism and foundationalism and argued that ideas are meaningful only insofar as they have practical consequences in concrete human experience; however today pragmatism has come to denote merely a general willingness to compromise principles, even to the point of selfishness or irresponsibility.  Written in an engaging and accessible style, Pragmatism is a valuable corrective to modern uses of the word, since the voice that speaks in its pages embodies precisely the opposite values from the pejorative senses the word has acquired.\\"	2005-10-12

Finally, we learn that \\"psychopath\\"  is \\"sociopath\\" now, among professionals.   And I liked that he reminds us that  the \\"perfect\\" person,  marriage, family, the \\"perfect\\" anything is  a fiction.  When someone is held out to be \\"perfect,\\" especially by their family, it can be horribly debilitating, to say the least.  It was also chilling to realize that there are emotional \\"vampires,\\" feeding off others' life blood so they can mimic being human.  Still - I've always had more faith in nature than nurture.  I believe Peterson was born with a predilection to be a sociopath...and to kill.   I've known and counseled people with far worse lives than Scott Peterson's - and they've gotten help and gone on to be good and caring.  The abused, the neglected, the \\"unloved,\\" who should be among the walking dead, but who've refused to let their pasts keep them from  finding and giving love - many have made life work for them wonderfully despite extreme deprivation. Some don't make it, I realize that.  I suppose Peterson is one of them.  But still - murder is the greatest taboo. You have to be pretty \\"bent\\" from the get-go to do it.	2005-10-13

But I truly think this is his best reading ever.  The sheer volume of the cast of characters means that Dale has to produce more original accents and voices with each book.  We must be up to hundreds of characters now.   <br /> <br />Particularly impressive in this installment is what he does with the powerful, poignant scenes near the book's end, especially as regards Dumbledore.  (I don't want to give away any plot secrets here; let me just say that Dale's voice shows us a raw and beautiful vulnerability to Dumbledore that we haven't seen before.) <br /> <br />I think this novel is Rowling's best to date, and Dale's performance matches it in skillful intensity.  It's fantastic.  Readers who zipped through the book when it first came into print will enjoy listening to the audio version in a more leisurely fashion later, noticing clues they missed the first time and reveling in the imagery Rowling has created.

Nichols type illustration done in pastels on the front cover---so reminiscent of the high-strutting Parisian walking her (yikes) dog on the cover of popular diet book \\"French Women Don't Get Fat\\".  At first, I thought this was yet another dieting treatise, yet another way to capitalize on America's love/hate relationship with our cheese-loving, wine-scarfing, chocolate-chomping buddies from across the ocean who somehow after all this eating manage to fit into those tight little couture pencil skirts and red and white apache tops.  And then I saw the cat featured in the drawing---mais oui, it was a cat. Bien sur, I said, ce livre, ce n'est pas serieux; c'est une blague.<br /><br />And then I got passed those cute little illustrations and actually read it.<br /><br />Okay, I'm being a little obnoxious, but believe it or not, Henri de la Barb, in the guise of a parody, has written an even more entertaining and informative book than Mireille Guiliano.  Guiliano's book, a sucre-filled memoir containing a French arsenal of vague tips detailing how she was defeated by the battle of the bulge  America-style and had to retreat back to France and the methods of a certain Dr. Miracle to re-attain her Gitane-slim physique, contains anecdotes and recipes spread over 200+ pages.  De La Barb, offers equally compelling information that can be utilized to actually lose weight with less than half the verbage, Veuve Clicquot-free advertising and ooh-la-las.<br /><br />Okay, some of the recipes are a bit on the 'cat'astrophic side---our feline amis/amies certainly recommend mice and not mousse---but the idea of eating real food (in this case, for humans) prepared well and partaking of only a small portion seems to eptomize the best of common sense / highly nutritional dieting. Les Chats de la Barb actually eat seasonally, recommend purchasing only enough food for a day, and sum up all their tips in a shameless abbreviated mimicry of Guiliano rather arrogant much ado about nothing.<br /><br />But his cats are practical too, knowing that they will not be able to run off on a whim to the local Dean & DeLuca's just to buy the best triple cream and Valrona truffle, he makes allowances for those situations where convenience is key.<br /><br />Consequently, De La Barb's book is much more fun and speaks la verite; we laugh out loud at his prissy little pussies and their over-the-top antics, but we are not quite sure whether or not to laugh at Guiliano's pandering of her nationality and the odd mystique it has over many Americans.<br /><br />C'est une blague, n'est-ce pas?

The edition appears to be 1976 and it is bound in a high-quality grained black leatherette, not burgundy leather.   <br /> <br />In all other respects, the binding is heritage quality.  It will lie flat on any page, and the detailing is meticulous: gold leaf on the outside of the pages, gold braid ornamentation on the inside edges of the covers, burgundy and gold heavy thread at the top and bottom of the spine stitching. <br /> <br />The paper and ink are top quality.  I could not believe this was a full large-print bible when I picked it up.  It is light and only 1.5 inches thick, so you can read it while holding it in your hand.  But although the pages are thin, you can barely see the print on the converse of a printed page (although you can see through empty pages to the next page).  The printing is crisp and clear, and will not smudge.  There is a ribbon attached to the binding to be used as a bookmark <br /> <br />The typeface is a traditional serif proportional font, either medium or bold.  Notes (cross-references, alternate meanings, etc.) are done in smaller light sans serif typeface at the end of each verse.  Each verse is indented, but there is a symbol to show the original paragraphs.  The pull weight of the pages is very high.  (I.e. the pages can't be pulled out and should not fall out, very important in a flat-lying book.) <br /> <br />I have found this Bible easy to read in every respect.  There are three nice extras:  a basic concordence at the back, four thick coated double-side pages of traditional family Bible recording matters (marriage, children, deaths etc.)in the very front, and four similar pages of excellent maps at the very back. <br /> <br />I don't *need* large print, but it really increases reading comfort and saves eyestrain for anyone without perfect vision.  I have had it for 6 months and so far it appears to be durable -- mine looks like new, with no torn pages, smudges,or scratches. <br /> <br />Actually, even if you would be happy with a hard-bound book volume or paperback, you might be happier with this one, due to its durability, its ability to lie flat, and its light weight.  You certainly won't get a leather-bound Bible of this general quality for @ $14 (in fact, you aren;t going to get a fine leather binding for $14 no matter what's inside). <br /> <br />In summary, this Bible is a phenomenal value if you want a top-quality, well-made Bible to read frequently, which looks like a traditional, expensive Bible.   <br />	2005-10-12

Farrell's book came out in 1972 was about the Sepoy Mutiny and a part of Indian History that is not well traced. Though there are versions of it, one wonders which is accurate. Thus it is an apt topic for a novel. He looks at it from various perspectives - the British, the Indians and the Princes. In bitter irony, he spares none and tears each of them. The book starts with mirth and gradually descends into darkness as the fight between the Indian soldiers and British intensifies. As is often traced in history, such darkness leads to reduction of ones senses and it is seen in the book. Though it only a novel, it captures all aspects of the story beautifully.  <br /> <br />It shows the collector as a ramrod person who sticks to his rules as a typical Britisher of the past. He has his positives and negatives and foresees the problem but is unable to cope with it. He thinks that he is bringing civilization to an uncivilized place and as the story unfolds, one wonders who is civilized. On a more concrete note, one understands the pros and cons of imperialism and how difficult it gets to justify it at times. Though the British were under the East India Company during this time, after this they moved under Royal Flag. That shows the extent of the impact this war created. This is one of most beautiful novels of that decade. Farrell travelled to India during the research for the novel and commented that he was more confused after seeing India than before. He was an eclectic author who wrote books like Singapore Grip, but this was his masterpiece. It is worth owning.	2005-10-10

It's quite thought provoking, although on occasion the author tends to overreach his data.  In fact, of course, there isn't much data in the book, but that's OK if you look at it more as a trigger for thought than as gospel.  It certainly makes you look at things a little differently, which is the stated purpose of the book in the first place.<br /><br />Charles Gramlich<br /><br />Author of \\"Cold in the Light.\\"	2005-10-10

For Mr. Harris that villain is religious belief.  He is astounded that some people in this would have the audacity to believe in a power higher than themselves.  Moreover, he is convinced - like a conspiracy nut looking for a grand unification theory - that there would not be misery but for the irrational propensity to religion.  Never mind that there would not be a Sistine chapel or Handel's Messiah either- humanity has been held back by monkish superstition foisted upon it by charlatans. <br /> <br />There is really nothing new here, except perhaps for the level of vitriol aimed at modern believers.  When you impose a philosophy of objective characterizations on a matter that summons personal and subjective beliefs it is called chauvinism.  When you condemn a people for their religious beliefs it is called hatred.  This quibbling mountain of twaddle somehow relishes in both.  Bowing in homage to the humanist altar of `science', Mr. Harris writes with myopic intensity that makes the reader question his motives.  Is he disheartened by American political trends which polarize policymaking on the basis of moral approbation?  Is he threatened by those who challenge the ironclad orthodoxies of his `Star Trek' like world-view?  I suspect that his work has its appeal for an insular minority of nattering intelligentsia, but almost no marketable potential as a political movement.  In the United States an object called the Constitution (drafted by pernicious Christians) presents a formidable obstacle to his `final solution' of eradicating religious inclination.  Atheistic fascism of the early 20th century failed to give this sort of ranting any political traction in American life.  Why should this book be any more successful?   <br /> <br />Somewhere a college professor is thumbing through this book madly with ecstacy.  I suppose even the nonbelievers have their Bibles.	2005-10-11

Between her breasts she was shamefully emblazoned & tattooed as \\"Feld Hure\\" (field whore) with SN A135633.  The camp had both Labor & Joy Divisions where she was forced to watch \\"Public Chastisement\\" in Execution Square where 20 nude girls, strapped onto chairs, were bludgeoned to death upon order of Master (Mistress) Kalefactress, a criminal prison releasee overseer for Nazis.<br /><br />Daniella is transferred to Joy Division, sterilized & used as sex slave or Pleasure Maiden in the \\"Doll House\\" which holds 50 inmates. These girls are required to provide sex to Nazi soldiers before their departure to the Russian front.  During \\"Enjoyment Duty\\" they are instructed to smile and act happy - if not, & they accrue 3 bad reports, they are beaten & executed.  The 50 inmates are depicted as being arranged into 2 rows of 25 girls each, back to back, & awaiting the ingress of German Nazi soldiers who then arrive & assemble with agonizing fevor at distinctly 2:00 PM daily. Throughout, the Master Kalefactress observes lewd acts.<br /><br />There is a perfunctory introduction & an inglorious conclusion which is scummy, unsuccessfully written and/or poorly translated, but even if meant to merely mimic a depraved person's thoughts -- it absolutely falls short.  Totally lacking is some level of explanatory preface to indicate fantasy, fiction or a level of genuineness or authenticity where \\"names & places were changed to...\\", etc.	2005-10-09

Our last-name devoided protagonist David stupidly makes a date for a girl named Angela on the same day and time as his grandmother's birthday. Then, instead of calling Angela to reschedule (something that I'm sure she would have gone along with), he came up with the brilliant plan of making a clone of himself using a device that he found on the beach.<br /><br />The character motivations weren't very clear. If this boy is in high school, then why is he still so stupid? He deserved every single bad thing that happened to him in this book, plus some that didn't. I usually enjoy William Sleator's protagonists such as Marco from Marco's Millions and the one from Interstellar Pig whose name escapes at the moment. This one had a disturbing combination of stupidity, selfishness, and thoughtlessness that made me cheer when a cement block almost took him out.<br /><br />Anyway, after creating the duplicate, he became offended when he realized that the duplicate wasn't a servile, creeping little thing. Apparently, he expected it to skulk around saying things like, \\"yes masther and no masther\\". The duplicate acted exactly like him, and for that, David acted extremely touchy and depressed.<br /><br />David also went out of his way to shoot down every suggestion the Duplicate (let's call him 'A') said. For some reason, he wants A to stay out of sight yet doesn't want him to hide. He then jumps on every possible opportunity to blame A for attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, rape, the extinction of the dodo, and global warming (okay, I made the last two up, but it seriously gets annoying to read through it since the narrative doesn't seem to realize how unlikeable this makes David seem).<br /><br />David and his duplicate make increasingly irrational decisions based on little or no thought. I emphasize again how weak their motivations were. Their blundering stupidity leads to a less-than-joyous ending (that I felt they deserved), and it left me with a cold feeling inside.<br /><br />I won't deny that I felt robbed by this book. I felt as if each and every dime I spent on this book had been ripped from my beating heart. I know Mr. Sleator can do better than this terribly generic title. His Interstellar Pig was classic. Compared to that, The Duplicate was just...forgettable.	2005-10-10

Divided into 8 parts, each being some broad topic revolving around 10g. The first Part is just background, on data modelling and what it means to run 10g under a unix or linux operating system. This Part should be easy review for most experienced readers.<br /><br />Part 2 describes the architecture and schema management used under 10g. And by the way, the book is focused on 10g; not on earlier versions. This Part is well worth understanding. It is here that the basic design information for laying out your database is to be found. You also find numerous utilities provided by Oracle, like the System Monitor, that help your management of the database.<br /><br />Some later Parts are straightforward but somewhat mundane. Specifically about installing 10g and making databases, and about loading data and backing up your data. To a DBA, this are vital tasks; don't get me wrong. But there's nothing too complicated here. And if you are a developer, these Parts can be safely skipped.<br /><br />Part 7, on performance tuning, is also where a developer should profitably check out. In tandem with understanding the basic layout of your tables, this Part may let you overcome bottlenecks.<br /><br />Given the size of the book, perhaps the best way to approach it is to focus on a single suitable Part at a time. Each Part is long enough to ensure a serious commitment of your attention, but still not be overwhelming.	2005-10-11

The battle the US waged against the Communists in Laos is still one of America's \\"Forgotten Wars\\" and what Jim does is give the war definition and reveals its human demension. The flying narrative is absolutely riveting--having personally flown with both Walt and Pterodactyl FACS in 0-1E Bird Dogs along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, I was instantly transported back in time some 35 years to those terror filled moments among hours of tedium...this book is FOR REAL!!! Jim does not sugar coat anything, relating the horrors of fellow FACS dying in a number of shoot downs and accidents with grim reality.  His struggles with higher ups removed both physically and mentally from the harsh truths faced by the FACS at the point of the spear make for both entertaining and ultimately frustrating reading--as the reader shares the author's angst with stupidity and lack of zeal to successfully accomplish the mission by his superiors. He gives a great look at how these mostly unknown and underappreciated warriors battled austere conditions, with humor and alcohol as their primary weapons while on the ground, and bravery and determination while in the air. This book is a great read and also an excellent primer on the plight of Laos during the US presence in South East Asia.	2005-10-11

What survivors may win from their chaotic experiences is a brittle, uneven, unkind strength.  Tabitha King's young protagonist, Kristin \\"Kissy\\" Mellors, brings that kind of strength out of the chaos of her youth.  We learn that Kissy was raised by feckless, undependable/uncaring parents and enjoyed no stability until she landed at Sowerwine University.  Her college is really her first home.  <br /> <br />At twenty-one or so, Kissy is a talented photographer with some issues. She doesn't like men, but she does like sleeping with them; unfortunately, she isn't very good at actually avoiding bad men, and she's not all that consistent with contraception, which has made for some trouble in her life and will make for some more. She seems to live with the constant low terror that a sensitive young person would feel, lacking all real backup and knowing that one false move may undo everything she's put together for herself, but not sure what kind of move is a false one. In the midst of senior-year stress and the aftermath of witnessing a tragic car accident, Kissy meets rising hockey star Junior Clootie.  The need for intimacy and connection is what Kissy and Junior share.  In a reversal of the usual sexual scenario, he's the one who admits his need. Sexual harmony (and hot sex scenes) follow.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, a serious mistake by Junior forever undermines Kissy's shaky faith in him, after which follow a breakup, a reunion, a contraceptive failure, a marriage...and then things really go downhill.  In excruciating psychologically accurate detail, the reader gets to see Kissy grind Junior slowly and painfully to little bits.  Furthermore, while so doing, Kissy also grinds herself slowly and painfully to little bits.  Junior is no more immature than most men of twenty or twenty-one and kinder, more patient, and more perceptive than the rank and file of humanity; he's an innocent in the wrong place at the wrong time, namely in the path of Kissy's destructive rage. The cycle is continued in the storm-torn, tossed-from-pillar-to-post childhood of their daughter Dynah.   <br /> <br />Tabitha King achieves the same feat that Tanith Lee managed with Rachaela, the protagonist of her Blood Opera series: creating an unsympathetic character who manages to command readers' interest and...well...sympathy.  Kissy, who seems to benefit from Junior's generous support even after divorcing him, is mean and venial and chronically unable to cut any other human a millimeter of slack, and yet it is no stretch to pity her at the book's desolate ending.  <br /> <br />Every instant of this character's experience is rendered with believability that leaves a reader thinking: \\"Yes, people act like that. Yes, they suffer like that. Yes, they're usually unable to stop doing the things that make them suffer like that. This happens all the time, everywhere.\\"    <br /> <br />I love Stephen King's books, buy every one of them as soon as it comes out, and read it until I either finish it or have a headache, in which case I finish it the next night. But Tabitha King is a better novelist than her man Stephen.  He writes about the symbolic language into which we translate our fears.  The devices of the horror genre are more-malleable, more-endurable ways to think about loss, dead ends, failure, humiliation, helplessness, hunger, and other true vectors of human pain.  Tabitha King writes directly about what we have to fear.	2005-10-09

We usually read the headlines of the Vietnam War in the newspapers but they would never be able to take account of how the war affected the daily life of the ordinary people at a personal level. Of course, living in a war torn country where many big conflicts of the last 20th century occurred, there was no way to escape the events as they brutally unfolded. The author is telling his personal story but it may also be a story of any other Vietnamese as well. We were caught in the middle as the Cold war became a hot spot in a conflict rivaling between the capitalist and communist ideology. This conflict was artificial imposed on a little and poor Asian country and its people. As telling by the book, the war had not only been found on the battle field, it was also found inside our families, brother against brother, sister against sister, sometimes even between far and son. Our hearts were torn apart and filled with hate, bitterness and suspicious. These scars are still visible today between the Vietnamese living abroad and their country men in Vietnam. The American could leave on 30 April 1975, 30 years ago, but we the Vietnamese are still haunted by the ghost of war to the day today. We are still looking at each other with the same glasses as during the war time. A new generation of Vietnamese has grown up both abroad and inside Vietnam. We just pray they will be able to forgive and forget the pass, starting the healing process, learning the history as has been told in the book like this one and others that have been published. We must learn about our history in order to not make the same mistake again. No kind of war is more brutal and cruel as between brother and brother. Just ask the Americans about their own civil war. The book is heart fully recommend to be read by anyone whowant to have an insight of the Vietnam War.	2005-10-09

Montaigne was a humanist and a skeptic in his philosophical approach, and essentially looked at his own experience as the first topic for examination always.<br /><br />The book of Essays was one he worked on periodically throughout his life, issuing different editions, the first of which appeared in 1580. Montaigne's style of writing is sometimes stream-of-consciousness, sometimes structured in more formal styles.<br /><br />Montaigne's stated task in his preface to the reader is for self-examination, but it becomes very clear that Montaigne sees himself as an 'everyman' character. He strives for full-disclosure; indeed, he writes that were he another culture 'which are said to live still in the sweet freedom of nature's first laws', then he might have appeared naked.<br /><br />This is a complete set of the Essays, together with a helpful introduction and notes for reading. As Montaigne added to his essays periodically, they are not necessarily in the order he wrote them, but this collection has preserved their order according to his standards.<br /><br />Montaigne's essays show a pessimism and skepticism, perhaps based on the kinds of conflicts between Catholics and Protestants going on, in France and elsewhere, as well as the periodic flare of plague. He was a humanist who saw cultures as having value internal to themselves and preferred to not universalise morals, laws and other ideas.<br /><br />Montaigne was sometimes conventional in thought (seeing marriage as necessary for children, and distrusting the idea of romantic love), but other times he was very much a free thinker (particularly when it came to religious dogma or absolutist kinds of philosophical paradigms). Montaigne had respect for those who followed religious codes and ways of life, but distrusted those who tried to impose such ideas upon others.<br /><br />Montaigne added to his essays twice in major ways, but did not strive for consistency or systematic ways of thinking - he declined to remove previous essays if they contradicted new writings.<br /><br />Montaigne is perhaps the most important French philosopher prior to the Enlightenment.

Now that I've read \\"Dry\\" I think I know what it is.  A gift for storytelling. It's easy to miss that in a memoir.  Granted, Burroughs has had a fascinating (in a train-wreck sort of way)life to work with, but not everyone can repeat the fascinating and still make it entertaining.  He certainly can! And given his somewhat acerbic style, I never expected to actually cry during the telling of his friend Pighead's dying. And yet I did, and was deeply moved. Although I couldn't tell you exactly why, which may be the real genius of Burroughs'writing...it's indefinable. I highly recommned this book, particularly for people in any kind of \\"recovery\\".	2005-10-09

Most of the book is on post-processing. This book assumes that you already have some idea of how to work your camera. Instead of really telling you how to do things, it focuses on how you can make things more easy on yourself.<br /><br />It discusses the preparation, the shoot itself and post-production of the images. It doesn't tell you how to shoot perfectly, because in many conditions this just isn't possible. It does discuss how you can deal with those circumstances, making them work for you instead of you work for them all the time. It's general in its guidelines, but in-depth enough to show you how to do things for yourself.<br /><br />This book assumes that you're a bit creative (which you really are, don't worry) and then helps you develop this creativity.<br /><br />There's a lot in there, too much to put in here. (And it's all highly organised and easy to read.)	2005-10-09

However, there is very little in this novella that compares favorably to the writers King expresses such admiration for. <br /> <br />The entire story involves two elderly newspapermen relating an unsolved mystery to a young female intern. The mystery itself is curious and somewhat interesting to ponder, but the brief length of the novel and the context in which it is written--essentially a long three-person dialogue--prevents much in the way of detail, character development, or motive. The idea, apparently, is for us to appreciate the mysteries of life, and recognize that reality is more complex than the standard detective novel with few clean wrap-ups. Towards this end, there is no resolution to the novel. What is more frustrating is the scarcity of information available for us to ponder. We know far more about the storytellers than the subject of the mystery, so how are we supposed to play with theories or hypotheses? <br /> <br />As always, King focuses on setting place and defining characters. In this case, however, I found the asides and tangents annoying; if the book is going to be less than 200 pages, I would have liked more of it devoted to plot or details about the victim, rather than repeated comments about the young woman's attempts to impress the newsmen and their fondness for her. It is a fast read, but not a particularly enjoyable one.	2005-10-08

Like John Wayne and Cary Grant, Bogart was larger than life, yet, unlike them, he was also down in the dirt with the rest of us. An average guy in many ways, the characters he played beat the odds, but only after enormous effort and struggle.<br /><br />A.M. Sperber's generally excellent biography shows that Bogart the icon and Bogart the man shared many similar traits. Though the son of a wealthy doctor and his artist wife, there was a dark side to Bogart's outwardly pampered life. His mother was distant, his father was addicted to morphine, and the young boy and his sisters, one of whom suffered from mental illness, were abused by the servants. Bogart was an academic failure with little hope for success until distinguishing himself on Broadway with his classic portrayal of Duke Mantee in \\"The Petrified Forest.\\"<br /><br />But even when Hollywood beckoned, life didn't get easier for the insecure actor. While James Cagney, George Raft, Paul Muni, and Edward G. Robinson were \\"stars\\" who got the best roles Warner Bros. had to offer, Bogart was taken for granted, a mere contract player who played supporting roles in the important projects, and spent years buried in a series of undistinguished B flicks churned out on the Hollywood assembly line. Well paid, especially by Depression era standards, he nonetheless struggled to support his ailing sisters and to pay off his late father's debts.<br /><br />Today, it's hard to believe his employers took so long to recognize the charisma and talent that Bogart would bring to \\"High Sierra\\" and \\"The Maltese Falcon,\\" both of which were intended for that great non-entity George Raft. \\"Casablanca,\\" of course, made Bogart the biggest star on the Warner lot, and Sperber shoots down the myth that both Raft and Ronald Reagan were initially considered for the role of Hollywood's ultimate romantic hero. For once, a role was tailor-made for Bogart, and the legend was born.<br /><br />Bogart's early life isn't covered as thoroughly as hoped, but that's not a surprise since most of those who could provide insight into the future superstar had died long before Sperber began her book. But the career is well documented, and the man behind the myth emerges as a flesh and blood figure, a fiercely intelligent and generally admirable one, on every page.<br /><br />Brian W.

'Johnny Depp Starts Here' is definitely an excellent resource for the serious film scholar. Pommerance synthesizes multiple strands of theory with the multiplicity/performativity of identity and works of Johnny Depp in an engaging and accessible manner. Having done previous film projects on Depp, I tend to be skeptical about texts purporting to address the actor and his works as what I have found up to this date, for the most part, more resembles an extended issue of 'Teen Beat' than an address of film, theory, or any scholarly engagement. This book, however, does not disappoint -- easily the best book-length text on Depp theory and film I have found so far.	2005-10-10

Filled with literally thousands of facts and figures, this is the hard-hitting and hilarious indictment of Republicans that I have long been waiting for.  Reilly exposes the true Republican agenda, how Democrats can attack it, and gives no quarter.  It explains how to win, strategic issues, offers a Red State Strategy, and explains how to save Social Security without raising taxes or cutting benefits.  After reading it, I've concluded that Bush is not a true Republican, a true Conservative, or a true Christian.  Anyone pissed at Bush or the Republicans will love this book.  It's got more zingers than Dolly Madison.  The first chapter, the Table of Contents, and more quotes can be found at the author's website.  Excerpts from the back cover: <br /> <br />\\"Republicans believe that if you enjoy sex, you are doing it wrong.  Bush fought a war on poverty and the poor lost.  Republicans follow the Bible until it gets to Jesus.  Cheney called the new Miss America unpatriotic because she wished for world peace.  With great power comes great responsibility -- unless you're Republican.  Bush dances around the truth so well that rappers are ripping off his moves.  If the dollar falls any further, Bush will have to peg it to the peso.  America fought a war with Iraq and Halliburton won.  The only time Republicans talk to blacks is when they challenge them at the polls.  Bush's foreign policy is so retarded it needs a special bus.  Is it just me, or does Tom Delay look like a big, fat Adolf Hitler without the mustache? The voter always wins -- unless Republicans get their way.  Bush is responsible for enough disasters to qualify for scripture.  He may not follow the Commandments, but he's pretty good at the plagues.  Bush hasn't choked this much since his last pretzel. A Republican future is so bleak that their only approval numbers are coming from Gothic fans.  Bush is slow making decisions because he first waits for the check to clear.  Republicans are backing off Social Security cuts so fast that they are practically moonwalking.   Why is Bush so weak?  Because knowledge is power.\\" <br />	2005-10-12

This is a beautifully and honestly crafted story of one immigrant experience.  The days of Maddalena's life are spent working as a seamstress, evenings she cooks for the males in her husband's large family, and her nights are spent waiting for her husband to come to her and praying that she will finally succeed in producing a child.   <br /> <br />Although so many sacrificed so much to come to this mixed society, the Italians lived in a neighborhood with other Italians, and resented (perhaps unto death) any influx of outsiders.  This book bravely raises problems that had no resolution - at least none in the fifties - problems of life and race in a sea of work and fear, of striving for monetary success, and of loneliness. Maddalena is finally able to make a friend, a man named Julian. He is like a gift, as he brings Maddalena music from her lost society, and although he is male, he is of a type apparently unworthy of her husband's jealousy.  It strikes me now - as I write this - that Julian is the only man in the book that I would care to share an espresso with, although meeting all of them has been most interesting.  The characters represent a culture that was the European immigrant experience - and Mr. Castellani has shown us a slice of it.  Well done! <br />	2005-10-10

Unlike Hastie's Statistical Learning book, it is not geared towards those with an expert level knowledge of statistics, and instead takes time to explain functions and formulas for the person with a decent but not extrordinary understanding of statistical/math concepts. For example, their description of a Gaussian was the clearest I've seen. On the other hand, if you're math/statistics background is considerable, you may find this book somewhat simplistic or tedious.    The book has a good coverage of techniques and algorithms, although I was somewhat disappointed that they do not mention Influence Diagrams, considering the amount of coverage of both decision trees and Bayesian techniques. Their discussion of Combining Multiple Models, however, is well done, and is not covered to this extent in most books I've seen. I also like how they broke out the discussion of input and output (knowledge representation) into their own chapters.    Addendum 10/30: After reading a good hunk of this book I still agree with most of what I said earlier, but I do think the authors could have gone into graphical models a lot more. At the end of the discussion on Bayesian networks, Markov networks and other graphical models are mentioned very briefly and the author says they are very big in ML right now, but he doesn't say why they didn't describe them further. It might have something to do with the organization of the book. Graphical models almost need a chapter of their own but the book's chapters discuss all techniques in one chapter but with varying levels of detail.	2005-10-09

What I love most about \\"We're Going on a Bear Hunt\\", by Michael Rosen, is that the adventure is being lead by a father!  In this modern era, dads are often left out of the picture (or the picture book).  Yet this book shows the beautiful interaction of a father and his 4 children (not to mention the family dog).  All the members of the family work together to help each other during the adventure.  They aren't running off it different directions, but they all have the same goal.   <br /> <br />But where's the mother?  I'm assuming dad gave her a much needed break, and she is off enjoying some quiet time somewhere.  And dad used the opportunity to take the kids on an adventure! <br /> <br />I suppose the moral of this story could be that we need to face our issues head on instead of going around them, but when I'm reading this book with my three boys, I'm not thinking of any grand moral to be taught.  I am just enjoying the time with them, as we embark on an exciting family adventure like no other!	2005-10-11

Hillary has a lot of weaknesses that have yet to come to the surface, but must in a national campaign. She is hated by a great plurality of the electorate, and not just on the right either. The moveon.org/Howard Deaniac wing of the Democratic Party does not find her support of the Iraq War very appealing or very credible.<br /><br />Condi, on the other hand, has one weakness, despite her considerable talent and intelligence. She has never run for office before. The Presidency is rarely an entry leval job, with the exception of successful Generals like Washington, Grant, and Eisenhower.<br /><br />Still, what a wonder race Condi vs Hillary would be. I agree with Morris' premise to this extent--Condi would almost certainly beat Hillary. An African-American, Conservative woman who has risen on her own talent becoming President would just be too potent an idea to resist. But a man with political experience on the bottom part of the ticket--say George Allen or Mitt Romney--and Condi would win by a landslide, changing the face of American politics forever and extending the Democrats' stay in the wilderness for many more years.	2005-10-11

Craig finds in this rejection more than doubt based upon absence of Biblical or Logical support, but an attempt by a Foreign Power (Papacy) to dominate Germany on the eve of Unification via the War of 1871-72.  With no discussion of the reaction to the doctrine elsewhere, it is unclear if Germans took the matter seriously while other countries with substantial Catholic populations simply accepted the decree or thought it too silly to think about. <br /> <br />The discussion of the Thirty Years War in Germany and the concerted policy by major European countries that Germany  remain a collection of minor states to avoid German domination of the Continent are worth reading.  The causes, life in and during and effects of WW I are hardly touched upon. <br />The enormous damage done to Europe by US foreign policy under Wilson is not mentioned, nor is the generalized fiction about Germany in the US and UK during this period.  A hint at the origins of modern Anti-Semitism is provided by a discussion of a handfull of Jewish swindlers leading to the Panic (Depression) of 1873. The role of war reperations from France due to the 72-73 victory by Prussia/Germany is discussed.  A point worth thinking about, but whose validity is not backed-up. There is not a word concerning how rhe Depression of 1873 contributed to the cultural environment into which Hiter was born about 20 years later. Perhaps such influence can be neither proved or inferred.  Considering how until the 1950s at least Southern children grew up hearing stories of Great-Grandpa's fight with the Yankees an hundred years before, the depression's effect on Hitler as a child must have existed.  Craig is a bit more realistic about Jews in Germany than most so-called historians who paint a picture of virgins amongst bandits.  There is no meaningful discussion of Germany's purposes after the Weimar Republic. There is no discussion of the analyses, especially Spengler's, of the struggle to preserve European (including American) civilization. The fiction that the UK and France attacked Germany in 1939 to answer aggression in Europe is not given the lie to. (Russia had attacked and annexed parts of Finland earlier during the 1930s.) There is hardly any discussion of the Hitler period.  As there are no worthwhile histories of the period in English, it is probably as well.  The horrors visited upon the Germans by Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill are hardly mentioned.  The hostility, even hatred that many present-day Germans have for at least elements of US troops on German soil is unmentioned.   <br /> <br />The one chapter in the book I found most disappointing is entitled \\"The Professors.\\" What I found most lacking is the origins of the German mindset, which Bertrand Russell claimed was shared by Jews who fled Hitler, and he characterized as abstract and complex instead of the British mindset which Russell thought more immediate, practical and simple.  The German invention of history as science in the 19th century is hinted upon.  The subject's regression into nonsense, propaganda and moralisms goes unlamented. <br /> <br />\\"The Germans\\" is a fun book to read.  It presents few challanges aside from a few untranslated quotations.  It sheds a bit of light.	2005-10-13

I loved the first six books of this series, but with Pillars of Creation, Goodkind seemed to lose his way. It was an okay story, but the sudden shift away from Richard and Kahlan brought the series to standstill. I applaud Goodkind for trying something different, but the experiment was an unfortunate failure, in my opinion. Shifting away from main characters for an entire book is what you do when you're re-visiting a world you've created to tell us more about it, like Bujold is doing with her three (so far) stand-alone novels set in Chalion. It's not something you do mid-stream in a continuing series. <br /> <br />Now, with the two books since Pillars, Naked Empire and Chainfire, Goodkind has returned to his primary storyline, to a degree, but has picked up the annoying habit of starting the story after the pivotal action that sets everything in motion. This is fine in a stand-alone book, but not in a series (again, in my opinion). It might even be fine in a series if it were done well, but it's not. <br /> <br />I agree with many other reviewers that this series has become a tract for Objectivism. That this was Goodkind's philosophy in the first six books was obvious; it was even a bit refreshing, since it went against the grain of the majority of the fantasy fiction out there. The difference now is, those first six books were well written; these last three aren't. Or at least, not as well. Goodkind still has a way with words, when he's not preaching. But he preaches way too much in these last two books. Richard's not even likeable anymore; even when I agree with his point, I find myself thinking, \\"My God, you're a complete jerk. Shut up already.\\" <br /> <br />The worst thing, though, is that none of these last three books really advanced the story. If they had, I could put up with the other stuff. So, why did I give it three stars? Because, objectively, it's still a pretty good read. But it's not up to his earlier standards, and it's certainly not what anyone thinking about reading Goodkind should start with. Here's hoping the next book finally kicks things into gear.	2005-10-11

'Grassroots' by Susan Fawcett is the book we use at the community college where I work for some of our introductory reading courses.  We also use this text in our Tutoring Center to help students get up to speed for exams, reading and writing in other courses (as almost every course on campus requires proficiency in reading and writing to a good degree).<br /><br />'Grassroots' is in many ways a writing workshop in a book.  It is not a creative writing text, but rather one that sets a firm foundation from which one can go on to creative writing, technical writing, business writing, website writing, and more.<br /><br />The first chapter explores the writing process - what is one writing for?  Who is the likely or intended audience?  How should a finished paper look?  Believe it or not, it is on this last point that so many grades have risen or fallen - a paper can be wonderfully written, but if it is scribbled on scrap paper rather than typewritten and neatly printed, it may suffer in grading, just as a letter from a business will not be as well received if it has spelling errors and problems with formatting.<br /><br />The first major section looks at developing paragraphs, which is a basic building block of letters, stories, articles, essays and other kinds of writing.  This includes brainstorming, freewriting, journaling, and outlining to make sure that ideas flow in a logical pattern.<br /><br />Units 2 - 8 are essentially grammar sections, looking at the mechanics of writing.  This includes sentence structure (including avoiding sentence fragments), verbs, joining ideas together properly, being consistent across the sentences, dealing with punctuation (does that comma belong here?), and some spelling review.<br /><br />Unit 9 has a good selection of short readings that can be used to exemplify the issues presented earlier in the book.  These include writing from well-known people such as Maya Angelou, Malcolm X, Dave Barry, Amy Tan, Leo Buscaglia and others.<br /><br />The book is very colourful, with lots of user-friendly adaptations throughout the text.  There are Writers' Workshop and Writing Assignments after each unit, and many Exploring Online sections, including links to many OWL sites (OWL is the acronym for Online Writing Labs).  This text also has an appendix dedicated to ESL instruction, and there are pieces throughout the text that link to ESL instruction.<br /><br />One of the best parts of this text is the incorporation of humour.  According to Fawcett, 'Humour is a fine instructional tool.'  There are comics, classified-ad bloopers, short stories and jokes throughout the text that make the reading and writing experience more fun.<br /><br />This is a very good text.lia and others.   <br /> <br />The book is very colourful, with lots of user-friendly adaptations throughout the text.

He is also progenitor of ordinary language philosophy and ordinary common sense. The sensible world is restored as a first principle; something that cannot be proven, but all must concede exists. And all perception is veridical. The Inquiry captures all the nuances of the five senses as we ordinarily have come to know them. Ditto, reason, which is the focus of the first Essay. Yes, reason can lead one into infinite regress, especially when it comes to causes and effects, but we necessarily rely on some element of reason (conception, imagination, judgment) to give us bearings in the world. The final Essay is on morality. It is the least interesting, if only because Reid appeals to the \\"Author of our being\\" to establish first principles of right and wrong. Even so, humans are endowed naturally with a moral sense so that many of the appeals to God could just as easily be appeals to our endowment by human nature. But the number of his first principles is inordinate.<br /><br />One of the problems with Reid's entire approach is the number of his first principles. I stopped counting after forty. Somehow that many first principles defeats the whole notion of first principle. Even if I agree with Reid that Descartes' starting point, the thinking self, is the wrong first principle, at least Descartes starts with one first principle and deduces others. Likewise, Berkeley and Hume, one to an idealist conclusion, one to a sceptical conclusion. Reid's approach is manifestly opposite. Since he insists so much of what we are consists of numerous first principles, soon the whole notion of \\"first principle\\" loses its meaning. In a sense, to save the rest of ordinary language and common sense philosophy, he must abuse the ordinary notion of \\"first principle.\\"<br /><br />Somehow, there needs to be a better balance. Surely, that man is sentient can itself be a first principle, and that man is a rational animal can be another, and from these two, the others can be deduced. Maybe not. That's the predicament of modern philosophy.other, and from these two, the others can be deduced. Maybe not. That's the predicament of modern philosophy.	2005-10-12

A novel about adventure, love and betrayal set in the fantasy world of Alagasia.  The story revolves around Eragon, Roran and Nasuada, three main viewpoints whose fates are intertwined in the quest to free the land from King Galbatorix's tyrannical rule.  The return of the Dragon Riders and dynamic relationships make this a story of epic proportions.  Recommended for ages 13 and up due to upper-level vocabulary and some violence. <br /> <br />This reading is definitely something to get hooked on.  Even though it's a fantasy book, there are underlying themes that anyone can relate to.  The importance of friends and family is one.  Eragon grew up not knowing a mother or father, but living with his uncle and cousin.  When his uncle died, he had to abandon his home to keep his town out of danger.  The only \\"family\\" he really has left is his dragon, which he loves dearly.  Unrequited love is another theme that links this story to reality.  Eragon falls in love with the elf Arya, but because of their obligations and the vast differences between them, Arya realizes and believes that his love for her cannot be.  The imagery that Paolini incorporates into this novel made me feel as if I could touch and encounter what he was describing.  He made his world beautiful and enchanting.  While I was reading Eldest, I was living out Eragon's quest.  The way Paolini writes the novel is what makes the story so engaging.  He has certain vocabulary and pronunciations particular to the world of Alagasia and the races of people living within it, reminiscent of the Elvin writing incorporated into The Lord of the Rings.  This allows the novel to become more involved and interactive. There is also a strong plot that allows this story to seem tangible and not far-fetched, as well as a great twist at the end that left me begging to read more, which is perfect since this is the second book in a trilogy.  Paolini's passion for fantasy and writing is definitely evident in his work, and I wouldrecommend this series to anyone with a love for fantasy novels. <br />	2005-10-09

I voted for Kerry and I just can't accept that I was wrong. I am not mentally or emotionally stable enough to accept that the guy I voted for was the wrong man for the wrong job at the wrong time. I voted for John Kerry and I just can't accept that all of things the pro democrat media machine  said to hype Kerry was, well, just hype and even so, didn't work to seal the deal for Kerry so he could win.    I voted for the guy that lost. I can't accept that. I know that Kerry is a loser. I know that he spent 20+ years in the senate and didn't do a thing. In all of those 20+ years he missed nearly every meeting and every vote and only made 5 stupid proposals which nobody took seriously and never got off the table. Yeah I know the taxpayers paid this guy $140,000/year to do absolutely nothing, but so what? They paid Bill Clinton much more than that for 8 years to do nothing.     I know that Kerry filled out the applications for his fake Purple Hearts. But so what? I wanted to believe that he is a hero. Why burst my balloon even if it's not true. So what if real heroes were denied Purple Hearts and awards? Kerry should come first.     I know that the silver star should have never been granted to Kerry, in fact he should have been tried for murder. But so what? Everybody lies and those people he killed, I didn't know them. So what if they were unarmed and defenseless? So what if he killed animals and people in the manner of Kenghis Khan? They weren't my relatives or my animals. Who cares?    So what if Kerry lied in that speech in Washington, D.C. back in '71 and so what if American POW's were tortured due to Kerry's allegations? So what if many of our loved ones are still MIA because of Kerry. So what if many of us were left orphans and widows all because of Kerry. John Kerry wanted to run for president. He planned it over 35 years ago. Why spoil his dream all because of incidentals?     So that is why I write these condescending reviews with names like Brenda Jr., Lisa Jr., Loyd, Heather, Avid Reader, Wedgie and so on. John Kerry is my hero. I want to lie, cheat and steal too. Maybe I'll run for office someday too. I'll just follow John Kerry's example. Lie like hell and get suckers to believe me. It nearly worked for him. And it was even closer for Al Gore. And it did work for Slick Willy. So you never know.    So these are the reasons for my stupid, incessant, cocky and condescending while totally worthless and false reviews that I write to defend John Kerry. Besides, there is a 1% chance that John  Kerry may become the #11 democrat out of 11 democrats to run for president in 2008 on the democrat ticket. So I have to hype this guy all I can.    Hope you understand.    Oh, and I only use Heinz ketchep too.    Now watch for my review by Avid Reader \\"A actual review (not really. I never read this book) of the book\\" coming up next. I love to change names and besides all of that, I have no life. All I do is sit in front of my pc all day long and write reviews.

Boulevard of Broken Dreams is a fascinating comic about the steady decline of an animator named Ted and the industry into which he breathed new life.  An animation company of the '30s era creates \\"Waldo the Cat\\" shorts, but with the rise of Disney, the company tosses originality in favor of the cutesy watered-down style that has become so popular.  New bosses, scandal, and tragedy rides the degradation of the cartoons all the way into the '90s.  And all the while, Ted is tormented by hallucinations of the cartoon cat he created.  This is the twisted story that Deitch has woven. <br /> <br />And it's a good one, to be sure.  From Ted's mind springs a popping, psychedelic world brimming with confusion and madness.  While Ted is engulfed by his delusions, the people around him, his shifty brother Al, his uncertain romantic interest Lillian, and the aging great Winsor Newton all face the harsh realities of a business that loses its heart.  The story makes references to classic animators, so cartoon history buffs can enjoy a few in-jokes.  Tension and mystery abound, and it's a wonderful story for those who understand alienation or like a bit of bizarro reading.	2005-10-11

I would say that this book is the summation of all his other books, a grand summary of his spiritual and aesthetic career but that would not be accurate.  Let us say, rather, that as Father Death comes for the Good Professor a concentration and consummation of his spiritual aspirations and struggles and his literary powers comes into being.  Bloom has had his game.  He has pontificated about things human and divine, he has sneered at his enemies in the School of REsentment, he has fathered forth readers and writers (such as the eminent Camille Paglia) and now he has to pay the piper. <br /> <br />He describes in this book waking up from nightmares of Yahweh after midnight.  He \\"gloomily and silently\\" walks downstairs where he sips tea, eats black bread, and reads wides swathes of the Tanakh and other Jewish and Christian writings. <br /> <br />For those to whom Bloom is a kind of cultural hero - the heretic Rabbi of all of us rebel readers - a dark cloud gathers over the words of thhis book while we contemplate an endlessly enigmatic Jesus of Nazareth and a catastrophic Yahweh. Bloom returns to his origins in every sense of the term origins.  He has been a Gnostic but now, this late in his and universal history he returns to the Covenant he can never trust and stares at his God and antagonist in the face. <br /> <br />I give this book five stars for Harold Bloom's doom-eager spiritual courage, for the sense of devastation I feel while reading his book, and for a provocation his book contains which is greater than the ages though not, of course, greater than the Ancient of Days.	2005-10-12

I chose this novel for a class read for a topic for coming-of-age. Not much to it for sure. Beckett loses her mom, gets her period and experiences some death in her life. <br />Some of the descriptions do not relate to the stories at all. The author tries too hard to make us understand what Beckett is going through. The author uses too much similes to give us vivid description which she is good at. The story itself is not contriguing. It does not seemed to have a acme point(when she figures out that her step mother is not what she thoght to be?) <br />The author tries to give forshadowing points but,she gives so much you know it has something to do with Gothic and Fantasy.  <br />J. Mendelsohn repeats hard with the \\"blood\\". Each \\"blood\\" seems to be meaningful in Beckett's life. <br /> <br />I give 3 star because the story was below the average line <br />But some of the language she used was good.	2005-10-11

I don't recall ever reading the development of psychosis in a character being accomplished so clearly, so chillingly realistically.<br /><br />This may be King's most symbolic, significant novel.<br /><br />Throughout the book I wondered, is this what it would feel like to be a famous author, a creative soul trapped by the tastes of fans?  One of the worst spiritual imprisonments would be to become known, loved, and sought after for a certain quality in a product, then be held hostage to that quality, to be compelled to continue to recreate, regurgitate that quality forever and forever with no hope for an amen, with no hope to ever take a tangent or get a new lease on writing.<br /><br />\\"I'm your Number One Fan.\\"  Each time Annie Wilkes said this, my hair would have stood on end if it weren't so thin, limp, and lacking, if I hadn't already pulled it all out in the first couple chapters of the book.<br /><br />If anyone understands the very essence of misery, it's Stephen King.  If anyone can impart the ultimate in that feeling in a novel, it's King.  Man, oh man, he did it.  Her put misery on the bookshelves for keeps.<br /><br />I'll bet he thanks God 24/7 that he didn't EVER write a Romance novel!  Or did he, somewhere in his deep, dark past?  Ashes to Ashes!<br /><br />Speaking of a man who writes love stories being held accountable by fans who've come to seek a certain type of plot from him, is that what's happening to Nicholas Sparks and his novel TRUE BELIEVER?<br /><br />The symbolism noted above seems to be prophetically in play.<br /><br />Has MISERY manifested?<br /><br />Is King a prophet as well as a master storyteller and major figure in the literary world?  Well, yes, most of his readers know he is.<br /><br />Some of Nicholas Sparks's fans seem to be compelled by genuine disappointment to leach the appeal out of his latest hardback, mostly feeling a lack of anticipated depth and intensity since TB didn't make them cry, as Sparks's other books have religiously done.<br /><br />I had been dragging feet about picking up TRUE BELIEVER as my first novel in Sparks's collection of romances.  The nearly daily repetition of comments about how disappointing the book was had made me believe it was not worth reading.  A few honest raves, though, kept the pilot lit for my desire to read TRUE BELIEVER (see my review) and draw my own conclusions.<br /><br />Maybe the ending to this story will be that Sparks agrees with Donald Trump's belief that any publicity helps his cause, even bad publicity.  Likely the regular rips of TRUE BELIEVER, balanced with the raves, will increase Sparks's sales, and he'll continue writing with new leases on  themes as his evolving talent demands.<br /><br />I have a question, though.  Why is criticism so mesmerizing that I swallow it whole, yet praise always feels too sweet to be real?  Is there something in that dichotomy which explains why horror usually feels honest and somehow true, while romance sometimes feels like a renewing wellspring of wishful thinking?<br /><br />Maybe we're dust to dust, with life and a few book preferences separating the entry/exit sandstorm.<br /><br />With Admiration For Craft and Shivers Forever,<br />Linda G. Shelnutt	2005-10-14

No. 1, Winter 1975 published the following review: <br /> <br />STRING CLASS PUBLICATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES 1851-1951 <br />By Charles Sollinger <br />Detroit: Information Coordinators, Inc. 1435-37 Randolph St. <br /> <br />This attractive 72 page book presents an interesting historical survey of class methods. It presents the origins of instrumental class teaching in this country, which by the evidence offered, goes much further back than is commonly believed. Accordingly the first recorded instance of instrumental class teaching goes back to Boston in 1800, almost a hundred years before the Maidstone movement in England which is commonly believed to be the forerunner of our class teaching system.  We learn that the Benjamin family established free violin schools in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Camden and Pittsburgh during the second half of the 19th century. Earnst Weiss, as associate of the Benjamin family, introduced free violin schools in Chicago. <br />The book also presents a detailed list of class methods for strings published prior to 1951. <br />	2005-10-11

Theophostic is highly consistent with my counseling approach based on an integration of the sound scientific principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy with the principles of heart-healing described in the Bible, especially the Davidic psalms (see scottlownsdale.com for description). In this book, Dr. Ed Smith does an outstanding job in making Theophostic Ministry clear and theologically sound.

It describes the relationship between Nathan and his brother, Tom, and their lives with their grandparents after the death of their mother.<br /><br />The second, \\"Remembering,\\" is a denser, darker tale, focusing on Andy Catlett, an agricultural journalist and farmer, struggling to find himself after losing a hand (and his direction in life) in a farming accident. Reviewing his memories during a trip to an agricultural conference he is finally able to come to terms with the realities of his life and their value. This book is a testament to the virtues of the simple life Berry has been preaching for years.<br /><br />The third novel, \\"A World Lost,\\" introduces us to the young Andy Catlett in the year his uncle and namesake is murdered, an incident which impacts his life to come. It is only when he is older and able to investigate the incident himself that he is able to learn the truth about his hero.<br /><br />Wallace Stegner wrote that he found it hard to say whether he liked Berry better as poet, essayist or novelist, that he is all three and at a high level.

It urges families to lighten up -- to stop excessive worry about traffic, poison ivy, kidnappers, snakes, and broken arms and let children go outside and have fun. It's easy. If you don't live near woods, any small patch of nature will do: This writer sings the praises of vacant lots, where beetles live under rocks and dandelion tufts wait  to be blown into the wind. Take your child outside and make a necklace of clover flower.  If there's a creek nearby, let him put his foot in. Find blackberries and pick them. If you have woods, encourage a fort.    Oh, brave, new mom am I. A few days this summer, I let my two boys, ages 7 and 9, ride their bikes with neighbor children to a nearby creek. They waded and played and had a picnic. The boogie man didn't get them; a snake didn't get them (though they did see a snake).  We called these days \\"wandering days,\\" quoting a children's book we like. They'll remember these wandering days much longer than any trip to the local science museum.    Thanks, Louv. This book is an act of love for youngsters.	2005-10-14

I guess the characterizations<br /><br />may not be the most interesting aspect of the book,<br /><br />but whole enterprise keeps the reader interested in<br /><br />what is happening, and what the future holds.<br /><br />I read this book a few pages at a time, just before going<br /><br />to bed. Not many books could have succeeded against<br /><br />those odds.	2005-10-10

Of course it isn't, because it never claims to be! This book is meant to be a simple introduction to Ayurveda, and does a wonderful job of doing that.  <br /> <br />I would go as far as to say that this book can change your life, because it underlines, emphasizes and stresses on one and only one aspect of Ayurveda: its simplicity as a way of life. The author succeeds in making you believe that you can actually do something about your well-being, even if you belong to the rush-rush fraternity of today.	2005-10-12

Charlie Fox's boyfriend is on assignment in Florida and he wangles her a job working security for the software company that's hired him. Her assignment, guarding the teenaged son of a star programmer, is annoying because the kid is a bit of a jerk, but she's out of cold England, enjoying the Florida sunshine, and able to spend the nights with her boyfriend--or at least that's the plan. But the plan goes very badly astray when someone tries to grab the kid at an amusement park--and opens fire.<br /><br />Unsure of who she can trust, fingered by someone as responsible for the killings herself, and alone in a foreign country, Charlie and Trey go on the run. When she tries to make contact with her employer, instead of help, more gunmen come after her. When she tries to find her boyfriend, she learns that he has disappeared, along with Trey's father. Charlie is dedicated to her job, but there's only so much one woman can do--and it would sure be easier if the kid she's supposed to guard wasn't such an annoying punk.<br /><br />Gradually, Charlie unravells some of the truth--that the software program is important, and could motivate murder, that there are multiple factions seeking the secret of the program, and that she's been set up as the scapegoat in whatever happens. Staying alive long enough to take advantage of what she's learned is going to be a challenge, though.<br /><br />Author Zoe Sharp plunges Charlie Fox from one danger to the next, barely giving the reader a chance to breathe. Readers may not be too surprised by some of the twists and turns that the plot takes, and there are a few cases where we wonder how a woman as sharp as Charlie didn't see things coming, but overall FIRST DROP is an enjoyable story.	2005-10-10

More than a decade later, transformed by a long spiritual journey through India's cocktail of gods and goddesses, she is less dismissive of faith. However, atheism is at her core, having been 'raised in a family of atheists' (p. 34).<br /><br />Sarah Macdonald's search for God is sincere, as sincere as can be expected from a non-believer. She leaves no stone unturned, no myth unchallenged. Through it all, she comes close to losing most of the hair on her head but never her acute sense of humor.<br /><br />Surely, few countries can hope to compete with the mind-boggling variety of divinity on display in India. Sarah's whirlwind tour of the gallery of gods exposes her to every major faith and more, including Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Sufism. More recent targets of devotion, such as Sai Baba, Osho Rajneesh, Yogi Bhajan, Jiddu Krishnamurti and Bollywood stars, are also discussed.<br /><br />'The only thing that can stop a bus,' observes Sarah, 'is the king of the road, the lord of the [traffic] jungle and the top dog. The holy cow.' For all their holiness, however, cows are treated dreadfully and left to feed themselves by rummaging through garbage disposed in plastic bags. Pieces of these plastic bags 'collect in their stomachs and strangulate their innards, killing the cows slowly and painfully' (p. 11).<br /><br />As we follow Sarah through her voyage, we realize that although many of the predictions, astrological readings, and palm readings fail to come true, the few that do materialize still manage to create some awe, at least in the author's mind.<br /><br />In India, 'saving face is so important that living a lie is accepted practice,' (p. 43) one that the author eventually also succumbs to (p. 46).<br /><br />She notes that the mantras recited at Hindu weddings are 'mostly all to protect the husband' (p. 63). Despite the purported rise in female literacy, Sarah finds that gold, not education, is still 'a girl's best friend - an Indian woman's social security, insurance and alimony if abandoned or divorced' (p. 54). And when things go wrong, 'death can deliver status and honor. The pull for respect and the shame of living in disapproval are stronger than the lust for life' (p. 66).<br /><br />Sarah's first foray into spirituality is a ten-day Buddhist Vipassana session with S.N. Goenka, which she describes as a 'brain enema' (p. 68). After some initial skepticism she discovers, 'silence is sensual, for my other senses are becoming heightened' (p. 73). The two Indian women in the group give up and leave on day three. It is no wonder that Buddhism never took hold in India. However, Sarah's understanding that 'the Mogul invasions wiped out Buddhism in its country of origin' (p. 150) seems to disregard the other half of the story whereby Buddhism was 'absorbed' by Hinduism and 'died a natural death in India' (The Discovery of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, p. 179).<br /><br />Next on the itinerary is Sikhism, which her friend informs her 'is part of Hinduism' (p. 65). Sikhs, who the author views as 'the Irish of India' (p. 89) for being the butts of jokes and emblematic of India's 'hair fetish' (p. 82), must, she feels, find it 'hard to look tough in a topknot' (p. 85).<br /><br />At the Golden Temple in Amritsar, 'the hairiest holy town on earth' (p. 86), she finds 'Sikhs washing the marble walkways with milk' (p. 87). She credits Sikhs for being 'the only Indians who understand that music sounds better if it's not making ears bleed' (p. 88) and describes the Sikh 'langar' (community kitchen), being cooked on fires 'large enough to bake an elephant' (p. 88), as Sikhism's 'up yours' to the Hindu caste system (p. 88).<br /><br />Located nearby is the Miri Piri Academy for Western Sikhs, converted by Yogi Bhajan and given new names according to their 'numerology' (p. 90). At the Academy, Guru Singh, famous for being 'the first white Sikh,' predicts 'it'll all end in 2012' (p. 92).<br /><br />Back at the Golden Temple, Sarah discovers that Indian Sikhs are 'confused by the turbaned white people' and view Sikhism as a 'birthright of blood . . . not for foreigners' (p. 95). S.G.P.C. official Gurbachan Singh Bachan enlightens Sarah about the special protection Sikhs enjoy from skin cancer because their hair 'absorbs the sun's rays' (p. 96). The author feels 'energized' (p. 100) by the encounter but rejects Sikhism because she isn't yet ready for God and, as she puts it, 'I hate a uniform' (p. 97). Also, she tells us, '[my husband] made me promise I won't become a white Sikh or a Hare Krishna' (p. 100).<br /><br />In Muslim Kashmir, Sarah savors 'twenty-one types of mutton' (p. 113) and finds that 'Sufism is struggling' (p. 123), 'death seems to be the only growth industry' (p. 124), and most people 'want Kashmir to be an Asian Switzerland; an independent peaceful state' (p. 119).<br /><br />Sarah finds Hinduism to be the 'least authoritarian religion' with an 'ingenious way of dealing with critics . . . Buddha rejected ancient Hindu teachings and the very existence of God, but Hindus insist that he was another avatar of Vishnu' (p. 142).<br /><br />'The river is not dirty, your mind is dirty' (p. 145), insist sadhus (saints) at the Kumbh Mela at Allahabad, where 'the three holy rivers of Hinduism meet - the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati' (p. 134). Sarah takes a 'vow not to eat meat' (p. 159) since 'the teachings of Hinduism and Buddhism have spoiled the pleasure of the taste of meat' (p. 187).<br /><br />Next, Sarah turns to 'Upper Dharamsala, or McLeod Gunj, [the] spiritual center of exiled Tibetan Buddhism' (p. 151). The Dalai Lama, she tells us, 'demands doubt, questioning and reasoning' (p. 154). She admits, 'right now the Buddhist way of living attracts me the most,' in part because 'Buddhism is proving it can move with the times' (p. 161). She takes comfort in the understanding that '[Buddha] insisted he never be worshipped or deified' (p. 163).<br /><br />The author then heads to Dharamkot to meet up with 'India's most ubiquitous travelers - Israelis' (p. 164). 'It was the Dalai Lama who encouraged the first Passover festival in this town full of exiled [Tibetan] Buddhists. In 1990, His Holiness invited a group of Jews here to ask them how they preserved their religion in exile' (p. 169).<br /><br />Rodger Kamenetz, who wrote about the event in his book The Jew in the Lotus, explains, 'After the Romans destroyed the Jewish temples, our people had to put the elements of worship into everyday life; the home is the temple, the family table is the altar and eating is divine communion' (p. 169).<br /><br />She writes, 'Most of the travelers here have just finished their compulsory service (boys do three years, girls do twenty months) and they all seem resentful and angry about a spiritual homeland that trains them to kill' (p. 166). Judaism, she says, 'is full of guilt' (p. 167).<br /><br />The reader is introduced to the varieties of Judaism. 'The Kabbalah is to Judaism what Sufism in to Islam' (p. 169). At the other end of the spectrum is the orthodox Chabad Lubavitch group, which 'only recognizes as Jews those individuals born of a Jewish mother' and believes in reincarnation (p. 173).<br /><br />The Bene Israeli of Bombay, 'believed to be the poorest Jews in the world,' insist, India 'is the only place where Jews have not been persecuted' (p. 177).<br /><br />The next stop is Zoroastrianism, 'one of the most ancient monotheistic faiths,' imported from present-day Iran, that 'probably influenced Judaism, Christianity and Islam' (p. 182), wherein 'priesthood is an inherited right' (p. 190).<br /><br />The Parsis, or Zoroastrians, are the 'most Western of India's ethnic groups' (p. 179) who 'became rich because they were firm friends with the British [who] gave them huge chunks of Bombay' (p. 181).<br /><br />The vulture they depend on 'to take them to heaven' is on the 'critically endangered' list (p. 179). Their faith 'has been polluted by the Hindu customs of their foster motherland; Parsis wear a sacred thread like Hindu Brahmans, most don't eat beef and they throw flowers into sacred waters' (p. 192). Some even believe in reincarnation. Their capacity for 'self-deprecating' humor is a rare sighting in India.<br /><br />Sarah keenly observes, 'Like Jesus, Buddha and Mohammed, [Zarathustra's] thirtieth birthday was a turning point [i.e. when he attained enlightenment]' (p. 182). She could have added Nanak and perhaps a few others to the list. She also notes with some frustration that the stigmatizing of women during their menstrual periods 'taints nearly every religion' (p. 188).<br /><br />When confronted with 'NO NON-PARSIS' signs at Parsi temples, the author pines for 'the inclusive, casual nature of Hinduism' (p. 186).<br /><br />Next on India's spiritual smorgasbord is the Mata Amritanandamayi Math in Kerala. Sarah isn't impressed by much other than Amma's stamina. 'Apparently she never has a day off and hasn't cancelled a darshan [viewing] in thirty years' (p. 207).<br /><br />In Bollywood, she seeks out Amitabh Bachchan, 'a man with three temples dedicated to him' (p. 234).<br /><br />From there it's onto Bangalore to meet Sathya Sai Baba, who 'says he is a purna avatar - a manifestation of God in human form and a coming predicted in the Bhagavad Gita, a Muslim Hadith and the Bible' (p. 238).<br /><br />Sarah is a witness to two miracles. 'Hundreds of Indians are waiting in ordered queues in total silence' (p. 240) and Sai actually manages to 'arrive early' (p. 241). Sai segregates devotees by gender, nationality and spiritual association and 'spends most of the time on the male side, chooses mostly blokes for interviews' (p. 241).<br /><br />'He has twenty-five million followers, including chief justices, an army chief of staff, ex-prime ministers, senior politicians and cricketers Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar. A court has already ruled his gold comes from God and it seems there aren't any Indian investigations into the sexual allegations' (pp. 241-2). Sai has said 'he will die in 2020' and be reborn as 'Prema (love) in Gunaparthy, Karnataka' eight years later (p. 242).<br /><br />After the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, Sarah notes, 'As I feared, there won't be any forgiveness or compassion, there will be more death and another cycle of hate' (p. 257). In a moment of despondency she turns spiritual when her husband departs to Kabul on an assignment for the Australian Broadcasting Company. 'I pray,' she writes, 'to preserve my husband's life' (p. 258).<br /><br />Jains, the book informs us, 'follow a religion that's often described as an extreme form of Buddhism' (p. 281) and 'don't really believe in a controlling creator that judges and directs retribution' (p. 283). Sarah is unable to accept the 'self-violence' of the seemingly progressive 'Jain ritual of santhara - starving oneself to death when all purposes in life have been served, or the body is useless' (p. 285).<br /><br />To the author, India, the land of her 'rebirth' (p. 289), is both 'the best of humanity' and 'the worst of humanity' (p. 67). 'India is beyond statement, for anything you say, the opposite is also true' (p. 107).<br /><br />In the end, India is unable to inspire Sarah to 'worship' (p. 106) much more than the air-conditioner. Varanasi, or Benares, she says, is the experience that 'has branded itself on me most boldly' (p. 290).<br /><br />India's secret for happiness, in the words of one of the author's interlocutors, 'We Indian people, we look at the people more poor, more low, more hard than us and we be thanking God we are not them. So we are happy' (p. 111).<br /><br />Sarah is still an atheist but feels that 'being an extreme atheist is as arrogant as being an extreme fundamentalist' (p. 121). She tells people, 'I'm a Christian by culture but have no God' (p. 129). She is incapable of surrendering to a guru because, she says, 'the Westerner in me is automatically suspicious of people who claim to be perfect' (p. 141).<br /><br />She writes, 'all religions, even the most inclusive of all, are ultimately perverted by humankind' (p. 286). But she neglects to acknowledge that all religions are the creation of humankind in the first place. 'I don't want to reject religion as the cause of human hatred,' she says (p. 287). Sarah's 'feelings on arranged marriages have changed' because 'lust doesn't last and couples with things in common do' (p. 219). In India, she's begun to see religion differently because 'it gives people with so little so much' (p. 244).<br /><br />She leaves us with the words of Jiddu Krishnamurti, 'When one loses the deep intimate relationship with nature then temples, mosques and churches become important' (p. 288).<br />The Parsis, or Zoroastrians, are the 'most Western of India's ethnic groups' (p. 179) who 'became rich because they were firm friends with the British [who] gave them huge chunks of Bombay' (p. 181).  <br /> <br />The vulture they depend on 'to take them to heaven' is on the 'critically endangered' list (p. 179).

What is Crow doing, collecting pieces of string, a button, a strand of tinsel and berries from a tree? The Crow has a special gift for the town and it's absolutely perfect! <br /> <br />Merry Christmas, Merry Crow is a charming story of giving, told in rhyme, which will attract small children and encourage them to enter into the mystery of the Crow's hunt to make the perfect gift.  <br /> <br />The illustrations are beautiful and speak of a time past in our society. I believe that this ability to impart yesteryear adds immensely to the book. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Merry Christmas, Merry Crow is a wonderful addition to a children's Christmas story library. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

However, I think the Dresden Files books are a great read. They're the first books I've read in years that haven't been a labor to get through--they're a fun, exciting series. <br /> <br />I just finished Fool Moon earlier today, and I admit, the inconsistancies of Dresden's character are sometimes annoying (SPOILER: for example, he decides to tell Murphy about the White Council and the Nevernever but doesn't get the chance... and yet when Dresden mentions the White Council in front of Murphy, she doesn't ask about it, and he doesn't clarify what it is. Perhaps the plot was too convoluted for Butcher to keep track of all the seeds he was planting?), they are minor errors and don't take away from the enjoyment of the book. In fact, even with all the bumbling heroes popping up lately--like a previous reviewer mentioned--this one seems the most genuine of the lot, and the most interesting. It's pulpy fantasy at it's best, and I can't wait to get the next book.	2005-10-08

Having said that, I am glad that I did not allow so-so reviews of this book to stop me from purchasing it.  My interest is in day trading e-mini futures.  Other books I have read relating to Elliott wave have only provided minimal general guidance.  This is the only book on Elliott wave that I have found invaluable.  It took a few readings and some practice but, low and behold, I can now (often) scrutinize a wave and determine if it is an impulse wave or a correction.  The beauty of this is that it allows you to know if you are still in a correction or if the trend has resumed.  It allows you to know if there has been a 5th wave failure or if some form of correction is still developing.  At the end of a 5th wave when the market is spiking up and down I can eventually tell if a new thrust in the direction of the trend is part of the trend and possibly the end of the 5th wave or whether it is just a part of a diagonal triangle.  I have a long way to go in mastering it but I can often see the C wave patterns and appreciate what is going on.  All in all, the market makes more sense to me now.  One reviewer commented that doing this would not be possible on intraday charts.  I would have to disagree.  Even small C waves can take 30 minutes to hours to develop.  Once the market has made enough of a move to recognize the correction you would only need a couple of minutes to figure it out even if you consulted the book.  So, in short, I am impressed and consider this the best book on trading I have ever read.	2005-10-14

Unlike the more recent book, however, Winchester ties the different strings together much more successfully and convincingly, and brings off the kind of complex fugal narrative effects he intends through the interweaving of these storylines. Although sometimes he makes claims for which he offers little support (such as his claims as to why the aftermath of Krakatoa led to the spread of fundamentalist islam in Indonesia, for which he offers all kinds of interesting speculations but very little convincing proof), the book is still edifying and intriguing, and shows off Winchester's unique polymathy at its very best.	2005-10-10

As the same time, I no longer crave a hot fudge sundae over a mango. Would it be hard to turn down my favorite junk food, the chocolate brownie? I don't know because I don't live for brownies anymore. If one stumbled into my path, I know one thing for sure. Eat it or not, I move on with a life that has passion beyond food.<br /><br />That philosophy evolved over the last 30 years. I was never a size \\"large.\\" But like so many of us, I was ruled by food. And I have worked with scores of persons who weren't quite as lucky as me. Their cravings for food were inextricable from weight gain and constant dieting.<br /><br />It seems that our emotional make-up perpetuates a desperate search for that one diet that defies failure. My search has been a different one. As a biochemist and registered dietitian, I pondered the mystery of why the process of dieting is ineffective - in the long run. This investigative process has spanned decades, and the answer has been surprising. Quite simply: Life causes obesity. Food is the vehicle. You become the victim.<br /><br />In today's world it's nearly impossible not to overeat too often and sit around too much of the time. But that's not the whole story - it's just the most obvious scenario. You are the target of more than worldly food temptations, spectator sports, and internet searches. You are at the mercy of an ancient brain struggling in a very different world, where food allows a few minutes of serenity, peace, or a \\"bite\\" of joy.<br /><br />These are exciting, yet scary times. The exposure to worldwide news 24 hours a day unveils the alarming increase in obesity as well as the shocking rise in anxiety, depression, violent behavior, and suicide. Is this a warning that life needs mending?<br /><br />In 1998, the medical professional acclaimed tht health care providers should counsel overweight patients to stop gaining weight. But as a health professional. what do you say? Do you suggest another diet? Will we continue to work blindly on calorie intake and body fitness, while the brain wallows in what might be called an unfit status for today's world? How can we stop gaining weight in such a state?<br /><br />Until now. the success rate for weight management is limited to a pitiful 5%. STOP GAINING WEIGHT presents the \\"big picture,\\" a rationale for why we are so drawn to so many unhealthy behaviors, what they have to do with weight, and how we can put these behaviors behind us, and in the process, stop gaining weight.  -excerpts from author's notes inside coversher diet?

The supposed theme is scandal and intrigue, beginning with the alleged arson at the opera house and trailing through a  glass blower's family arguing about the business and a woman who is said to have tried to steal an archive and failed. None of it is very convincing; none of the accused have plausible motives; the sources seem random; some of the writing is piercingly shrill; and on the whole, who cares? For anyone interested in Venice, there are hundreds of books available, and this one ranks very near the bottom.	2005-10-13

The big advantage of this chapter in their fictional lives over previous ones is that Agatha Christie does not have them embroiled in a rather weak political/spy drama, naive politics always being a flaw in her writing.  This is actually one of better of Christie's mysteries with many wonderfully dark ideas throughout that provide more fun than the usual stock amount of red herrings.  This book effectively combines the dark deeds of the author's later books with the sense of fun of the earlier ones which can sometimes be lacking in the later Christies.	2005-10-13
